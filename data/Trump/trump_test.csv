2542,"Brad Pitt reportedly dating Princess Charlotte of Monaco

Find out the ins and outs of the allegeÂ­d 'love story' here

Following a bitter break-upÂ from actress Angelina Jolie, rumours surfaced suggesting Fight Club star Brad Pitt to have moved on. That too, with a princess â Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco to be specific, reported Australian magazine New Idea.

The two allegedly made their public appearance as a couple last week as they attended a Los Angeles Country Museum of Art event together, the magazine further reported.

Angelina Jolie: Brad Pitt is âterrifiedâ that the truth will come out

âNo one could believe it when we saw them together,â sources told the magazine. They continued, âThere have been rumours circulating for weeks that Brad has moved on with a new woman but no one was ready to see him hand-in-hand with royalty from Monaco.â

31-year old Charlotte and Brad were seemingly introduced to each another by BradâsÂ AlliedÂ co-star and good friend Marion Cotillard as she is very close friends with Charlotte. Marion, who Brad has previously been linked with, was keen for him to find happiness after Bradâs messy splitÂ with Angelina.

Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie

However, Gossip Cop has called the Australian magazine out on this story and went on to âset the record straightâ. Gossip Cop is a website that patrols the celebrity gossip industry in search of discrediting untrue rumours.

Not only are the actor and royal not dating, she isnât even a princess, reported the online platform. CharlotteÂ is theÂ daughterÂ of Princess Caroline of Hanover and is not a princess herself. She is the granddaughter of actress turned Princess Grace Kelly.

After checking in with Brad himself, Gossip Cop went on to state that the actor exclusively assured them that he and Charlotte are not in a relationship. New Ideaâs article regarding the non-existent relationship was simply bogus.

2562,"Ellen DeGeneres Is Now In The Middle Of Kelly Ripa And Michael Strahanâs Feud After Segment On Her Show

It is a known fact that there is bad blood between Kelly Ripa and her former co-chair, Michael Strahan, and now Ellen DeGeneres is caught in the middle.

Last month, the host of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Strahan sat down for a silly segment.

The two popular TV personalities tackled various topics. The episode was well received, and the millions of people who watched it saw nothing out of the ordinary.

However, according to sources, who spoke to Star, Portia de Rossiâs wife is having what would be considered as buyerâs remorse.

It is being claimed that the host of LIVE did not appreciate DeGeneresâ having her nemesis on the show.

According to the the the publication, Ripa felt betrayed by DeGeneres whom she considered as a friend.

Aware that she got on Ripaâs nerves, DeGeneres has allegedly reached out and apologized for the mistake.

It is not known if Ripa has accepted such apology nor if the ladies have been able to amend their friendship.

The former American football defensive end and Ripa were the co-hosts of Live! with Kelly and Michael from 2012 to 2016.

In spring 2016, he abruptly left the show to join ABC morning television show, Good Morning America.

The ex-athlete was slammed on numerous occasions by Ripa who said she was furious over Strahanâs decision to dump her without warning.

Strahan hit back by stating: âThe most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy because I value the way I carry myself. I do not want people to see me as âOh, he just ran out, just left them there.â That is just not true.â

Strahan confirmed that they no longer talk.

In a past interview, he said: âAt one point I think we were friends. I do not know what happened at the end. I learned a lot from her, though.â

He added: âI was not surprised by her reaction at all, but I cannot control somebody elseâs actions. I was there four years, and it is about more than just being in front of the camera.â

An article recently appeared on BET, where an insider said Strahan wants to have a sit-down with Ripa.

The source revealed: âMichael is 100% behind meeting with Kelly and clearing the air. These two were TV-husband-and-wife for many years and to go from seeing someone five days a week to having zero contact makes no sense to him. Through mutual friends, Michael has made it clear that he would love to set up drinks or a private meeting with Kelly.â

It is being claimed Ripa has turned him down.

Has Megyn Kelly gotten plastic surgery?

The TV star sparked rumors she's gone under the knife after her first-ever Today appearance on Thursday, June 1.



Rumors have previously circulated that the TV star may have gotten Botox, a nose job, and maybe even breast implants. However, Megyn, 46, has never addressed the talk that she's gotten procedures done throughout her career.


However, surgeons have exclusively weighed in on the topic to Closer Weekly! Dr. Andrew Miller suggests, ""I don't see anything other than possibly a little Botox for the forehead and crowâs feet.

Dr. Mardirossian adds that she may have gotten Botox to the forehead, a rhinoplasty, and filler to her cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and possibly to her jawline.

Megyn isn't only making headlines for her changing face! During her NBC debut, she seemingly snubbed Today co-host Hoda Kotb â and who knows if she even realized she did it!

Forget ""Pearl Harbor"" â Hollywood is buzzing about a true-life scandal involving the paternity of the $140 million blockbuster's director, Michael Bay.

Finally addressing rumors that have circulated for years, legendary director John Frankenheimer admitted he had a one-night stand with the adopted Bay's birth mother, who claimed he was Bay's dad â and that he paid her off.

But Frankenheimer denied ""absolutely, categorically"" that he is the younger director's father.

""We had tests done, and I am not his father,"" Frankenheimer told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published yesterday.

Bay, 37, who's in Honolulu for the premiere of ""Pearl Harbor,"" declined to respond to the bombshell revelation.

""It's a private matter,"" Bay said of the story â which Frankenheimer, 71, unleashed just five days before the release of ""Pearl Harbor,"" one of the summer's most highly anticipated movies.

The older director said his ""one-night stand"" with Bay's birth mom â who was not identified â happened at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel while he was making ""Seven Days in May"" in 1963.

Months later, Frankenheimer got a call from his lawyer, the late Frank Wells, who said the woman was pregnant â and had named Frankenheimer as the father.

""I asked Wells, 'What can we do?'"" said Frankenheimer, who feared a scandal would hurt his career. ""We can pay her off,"" the director quoted Wells as advising him. So Frankenheimer paid the mother $7,500, and says he ""didn't hear anything more about this"" until 16 years ago.

By the mid-1980s, Bay, adopted and raised by Jimmy and Harriet Bay in L.A.'s Westwood section, was an aspiring filmmaker trying to find his birth parents.

""I [did] a little investigation,"" Bay told the Times. ""I found [my mom] in three days.""

Then Frankenheimer got a call from the woman's lawyer.

""He said there is a young man at Wesleyan University, and he wants to find out who his real parents are,"" Frankenheimer recalled.

2490,"George Clooney's $220M Wedding Disaster - Prenup Feud, Guest List Flub & Planner Quit!

George Clooney's upcoming nuptials to fiancee Amal Alamuddin is turning out to be disastrous - a prenup the couple has been arguing over, worries about a guest list feud and their wedding planner quitting - and the couple might not even make it down the aisle!

A new report from The National ENQUIRER claims the Hollywood playboy has been negotiating and ""fighting"" with soon-to-be wife's legal team over a $220 million wedding contract.

""Clooney is worth an estimated $220 million. Given his shaky track record with women over the years, including a difficult divorce from his first wife and the brief longevity of most Hollywood marriages in general, I think he needs to make sure he has a prenuptial agreement that's ironclad,"" divorce attorney Raoul L. Felder told The ENQUIRER.

""He has a lot to worry about and a lot to lose if he doesn't proceed with the utmost care and caution. The fact that (his fiancee) is a lawyer is strike one against him. I expect his lawyers are being very careful and 'fighting' her lawyers over every point.""

Indeed, Alamuddin's intellect and successful career was an attraction for Clooney, but now it may work against him.

Adding tension to the Lake Como ceremony is an old scandal surrounding one of Clooney's best buddies, Brad Pitt - his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston and current partner Angelina Jolie.

""At first she was on the fence about going,"" the source said of Jolie, ""because she's not big on schmoozing at Hollywood get-togethers. But she quickly changed her mind after George told her that President Obama RSVP'd 'Yes'!""

Pitt was going with or without her, the source noted, and Aniston also remains confirmed on the guest list.

""George is extremely concerned that by inviting both these women, they'll undoubtedly try to upstage each other and in doing so take the spotlight off the bride,"" the insider told the magazine.

According to Life & Style, the shows were neck and neck with numbers during Megyn's first day in late September. At that time, Megyn very closely beat Kelly and Ryan by 172,000 viewers (2.932 million vs. 2.760 million). The best part for Megyn? She outnumbered them in the prime age demo: 25 to 54.

However, after a few bad interviews (who could ever forget the Jane Fonda and Will & Grace cast mishap), Megyn's ratings have gone down by 14 percent, which means Kelly and Ryan have taken the lead back. And the Today execs are totally not happy about it. ""Megyn just doesn't come across to the viewers as authentic,"" a network inside told Life & Style.

Things have been difficult for Megyn since her NBC debut. At this point, she's even having trouble getting A-listers to appear on her show. ""Megyn hasnât been able to book any big-name stars that havenât been on Today during the first two hours,"" a source told In Touch. ""Hollywood hasn't exactly put the welcome mat out for her.

Halle Berry, 50, has sparked rumours she is expecting her third child after debuting what looks like a âbaby bumpâ on the red carpet at the 16th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in Los Angeles.

The Oscar-winning actress looked stunning in a clingingÂ silver sequinned dress and matching heels and posed for cameras with her hands on her tummy as though protectively cradling her âbumpâ.

Halle has yet to announce she is pregnant but when she turned to the side the bump was prominent in her dress and Halle seemed happy to show it off.

The star is not known to be dating anyone and last week posed on Instagram in a top that read âNo more boyfriendsâ.

She captioned the photo: âSummerâs comingâ¦ letâs shine up our crowns ladies!â

Last night social media went into meltdown with speculation of who the baby daddy may be.

The Oscar-winner has two children already, having given birth to her second at the age of 47.

Halle had previously thought she was perimenopausal when she discovered she was pregnant with son Maceo to her French actor husband Olivier Martinez, who she divorced in December 2016.

The bump was even more prominent when Halle posed to the side [Picture: Splash] She has a nine-year-old daughter Nahla to Gabriel Aubry from a previous relationship.

Back in 2014, Halle said she was shocked to find out she was pregnant at 47.

âThey call it a geriatric pregnancy,â she said at the time.

âI was, you know, on my way â¦ this is probably way TMI, but I was really, you know, kinda premenopausal so to have this happen was a huge [shock].â

âI mean, I didnât think it was possible to have another baby â¦ So, Iâve learned never to say never.â

If she is she will be in good company as Janet Jackson recently gave birth at 50.

Or maybe Halle is playing us all along and itâs just a food baby in thereâ¦

The former football star, 70, who was acquitted of double homicide in 1995 and completed a nine-year prison stint on Oct. 1 for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping, has known Caitlyn, 68, since she was Olympic gold medalist Bruce.

2656,"Is Ryan Seacrest Quitting 'Live'?

Ryan Seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in New York City. The talk show and radio host is renting a place in Manhattan so that he can be in the Big Apple during the week in order to host Live! with Kelly Ripa each morning. However, a new report from Radar Online claims that Seacrest â who had previously been living in Los Angeles â is âmiserableâ on the East Coast.

âRyan is miserable. [Moving was] the biggest mistake of his life. He hasnât embraced the city and hasnât been going out to the restaurants or parties. Heâs invited to almost every event every night and doesnât go! Heâs such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much. He canât wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved LA,â a source told the popular gossip site.

Although Radar Online doesnât name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time, this one has some people convinced. It seems more than obvious that Seacrest loved living in Los Angeles and he travels to the West Coast so frequently that one could assume heâs unhappy in New York. He has been rooted in California for years and is used to a different way of life. Moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone, let alone someone famous who has loved that LA lifestyle for so long.

This new report coincides with constant rumors that Seacrest and his Live! co-host, Kelly Ripa, arenât getting along. Although the two have been pals for many years, sources have said that they are at each otherâs throats and that their on-air chemistry (which some fans wouldnât argue doesnât even exist) ends the moment the cameras stop rolling.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, ratings on Live! have dipped since the announcement that Seacrest was the new co-host. However, that dip was almost to be expected, given the hype built up around the announcement, which had been building for a whole year. However, sources have said that Seacrest wasnât Ripaâs first choice â and maybe not even her second choice. For fans of Live!, Seacrest wasnât even in their top five (favorite contenders included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Fred Savage, Jerry OâConnell, and even Kellyâs husband, Mark Consuelos).

So, if any of these rumors are true, will Seacrest end up leaving Live!? It is definitely a possibility. However, the gig hasnât seemed right for Seacrest since his name was announced on Monday, May 1. Some fans feel that he wasnât the best choice to be Ripaâs co-host â and maybe thatâs going to turn out to be true.

There are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that Seacrest is going to leave Live! in 2018. It is entirely possible that he will want to move back to Los Angeles â and that he may ink a deal to host the new American Idol. That gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him.

Details of Seacrestâs contract with Live! are unknown. He may have signed a one-year deal or he may have signed a multi-year deal. However, there are always ways for someone to get around something if they arenât happy or itâs not working.

2610,"Why Celine Dion and Cher hate each other

Cher wowed the crowd in a barely-there crystal encrusted outfit yesterday as she belted out âIf I Could Turn Back Timeâ and âBelieveâ at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards.


But while the audience were thrilled with her performance, fellow singer Celine Dion was reportedly left unimpressed.

The legendary singers (who both take up residency in Las Vegas) sang at the BBMAs yesterday.

Dion was allegedly left fuming after Cher stole her thunder from the night despite giving a show-stopping performance of Titanicâs âMy Heart Will Go Onâ 20 years after the single was released.


âThere is already so much animosity between the two of them,â a source told Radar Online.

âDion did her best to save face last night. But Las Vegas is her stomping grounds, and she felt like she should have been allotted more time for her performance.â

Cher, on the other hand, âdoes not care at all about the drama.â

2592,"Keith Urban Jealous: Nicole Kidman Admits She Begged HBO To Cast Alexander Skarsgard As Her Love Interest | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Nicole Kidman is making it pretty clear that she desperately wanted Alexander Skarsgard to be cast as her husband in âBig Little Lies.â Nicole is starring in the new HBO drama series along with Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern. The show tells the story of three mothers who try to move on after a tragedy that almost destroyed their lives.

The Hollywood actress even said that she almost begged producers to cast Alexander, who is often regarded as one of the hottest stars in the celebrity world. In fact, Nicole even told Vulture in a new interview, âYeah, he was so good. I wanted him badly! I was like come on, please. Come on, HBO, weâve gotta get him. And, obviously, heâs very tall as well, which is really, really helpful for me. Itâs not often that I look small. So physically heâs very dominating as well, which is frightening, but I take him on.â

With that being said, a lot of Nicoleâs fans canât help but wonder if she might be throwing a little shade towards her husband Keith Urbanâs direction. After all, Nicole often towers him whenever they are on the red carpet together.

Plus, Nicole has even admitted that Keith doesnât feel comfortable watching her love scenes with Alexander on âBig Little Lies.â She said that even though Keith understands that her intimate sex scenes are part of her job, the country singer still watches them with only one eye open.

Of course, itâs not surprising that Nicole Kidman would want to work with someone like Alexander Skarsgard. Heâs a Hollywood sex symbol. Plus, the characters on âBig Little Liesâ often comment on how beautiful Nicole and Alexanderâs characters are on the show. Together, they are a perfect couple on the outside, but with plenty of deep dark secrets that no one knows about in the inside.

Knowing how much sex appeal he has, itâs no wonder that Nicole wanted to be paired with him on the small screen. No one else can play a troubled, yet sexy husband, father, and businessman the way Alexander does.

Tell us, are you surprised that Nicole Kidman wanted Alexander Skarsgard in âBig Little Lies?â What do you think of Nicoleâs role on the show?

Betty White is planning to quit TV acting at 95 to check items off her bucket list!

RadarOnline.com can reveal the surprising things the TV legend, who won Emmys playing Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, still plans to accomplish before hitting 100 â including Broadway theater, wild adventures and even romance!

After the cancellation of her TV series Hot in Cleveland in 2014, Whiteâs telling pals sheâs closing up shop.

âShe feels she can live to 100 and has other things she wants to do with her life,â a friend says.

Topping her list is travel. Instead of visiting cushy resorts, sheâs planning on a real adventure.

âBetty says she wants to go on an African safari,â reveals her pal.

âShe also wants to spend more time with her friends before they all pass on.â

And she hasnât totally given up on acting. Her true dream Â­is to star on Broadway.

âThatâs definitely on Bettyâs bucket list,â the friend says. âShe hasnât done much live, on-stage work and she thinks it would be a perfect cap to her long career to appear on Broadway.â

The friend says Betty takes pen to paper nearly every day to finish a new memoir, and sheâs also working on a script for a romantic comedy!

Since she has no children, she plans to leave her $45 million fortune to animal welfare groups founded by her husband, Allen Ludden, a game show host who died in 1981.

While she could still find work on TV, the source says Broadway is the only reason sheâd return to acting.

âBut if her acting career is over, sheâs at peace with it. She wants to enjoy her time, without everyone fussing over her!â adds the pal.

2591,"Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake on the brink of divorce

The American magazine OK! announced the five-year-marriage has come to an end

Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have decided to go separate ways.

According to the American paper, this could be one of the most expensive divorces from the industry, considering the pair possesses a $300 million fortune.

Apparently, their marriage started to crumble because the conflicts related to their child, careers and Justinâs âother womanâ multiplied.

Last month, Jessica attended the Emmyâs Awards Gala alone, looking sad and weak.

According to sources inside their entourage, the situation is the same for months now.

The Emmy Gala was a pretty big deal for Jessica and they usually support each other when it comes to such things.

The fact that Justin refused to be with her proves their relation has deteriorated.

It seems that Justin was on the night of the gala in Brazil, where he performed in a concert, but Biel was obviously bothered by his reaction because he didnât make any effort.

âJess feels many times as if she is a single mother and became tired of this. She does not trust him anymoreâ, revealed a source for OK!, stating that Biel and Justin are also fighting because he is cheating on her.

American singer and actor Justin Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel on October 19, 2012 in southern Italy, after a five-year relationship that began in 2007.

The two artists got engaged on Christmas 2011 and they have a son, Silas Randall Timberlake, who is now two years old.

Kanye West sparks retirement speculations after he recently deleted his social media accounts. Rumor has it, the ""Famous"" hitmaker is planning to step away from the spotlight for an indefinite amount of time. 

""Kanye never found the happiness he was looking for by being famous. In fact, if anything, the spotlight made him unhappier. He has decided to take a break and step away for a while,"" sources reveal. 

""Not going to the Met ball was a big deal for him,"" the sources tell Naughty Gossip, ""He loves that event and thinks of himself as a serous designer. He has just had enough and doesn't care if he is never photographed again."" 

Kanye recently resurfaced in Malibu after reportedly making a trip to Wyoming mountaintop to record his new album. He tried to avoid public events as much as possible after he experienced a breakdown during his concert last year.

Jennifer Aniston is looking to adopt a baby from south ofÂ the border - just weeks after The National ENQUIRER revealed her heartbreak over her estranged brother announcing that he was becoming a father yet again!

And the decision to head into Mexico for a baby was made easier by the years she's spent doing charity work for The Casa Hogar Sion Orphanage in Tijuana!

The ENQUIRER first discovered Jennifer helping out the kids of the Tijuana orphanage back in 2010. ""When you drive up to this place,"" said Jen, ""you see these kids come running out and you hear a chorus of, 'La, la, la, la!'""

But the former ""Friends"" star has endured a number of frustrating attempts to get pregnant with her own child.

Jen, 47, even froze a number of her eggs shortly before she turned 39 on Feb. 11, 2008.

Now her 2015 marriage to Justin Theroux has the newlywed celeb ready to look at the orphanage in a whole different light!

Carmen Gonzalez, who operates the orphanage, told the UK's ""Heat"" magazine: ""I am very happy. I wish that I could speak more about it, but, because of the rules we have to operate under, I can't.""

But other insiders are reporting that they're hoping that Jennifer will finally return from a trip to Tijuana with a baby of her own!

Meanwhile, A.J. is still anticipating the birth of his next child. Her sibling may not even know about Jennifer's plan to adopt. A.J.Â has no use for his famous sister'sÂ fame - adding: ""It's been a pain in my ass for years!""

2455,"Did Meek Mill Find Nicki Minaj In A Lesbian Tryst With Young M.A.?

Finding a story about Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill isn't exactly a stretch. Last year, Meek Mill's beef with Canadian rapper Drake kept us entertained for months, and Minaj is hardly low-profile. Over the past few years, Minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. As a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj story. In recent weeks, most stories about Mill and Minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop's power couple are still dating or not.

In recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that Meek Mill walked into Minaj's dressing room to find her and female rapper Young M.A. in a lesbian tryst. Ace Showbiz has speculated that Meek Mill and Minaj split last month after Meek lost his cool. Mill went on an Instagram rant at Minaj and then deleted his account. The same site reports that MediaTakeOut claims Minaj has become infatuated with female rapper Young M.A. and has split with Meek as a result.

All Hip-Hop claims that Minaj ""plays for both teams"" and says that she certainly has ""rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious.""

Of course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest Mill-Minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. Indeed, a glance at Minaj's Instagram account suggests that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed Halloween together. Nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with Mill.

Gossip Cop reports that the stories claiming Mill and Minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers.

""The webloid's perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. Minaj and Mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on Instagram Monday morning. ""And while the relationship might not last forever, Minaj is not ""dropping"" Mill for Young M.A. MediaTakeOut should probably start looking elsewhere than Twitter and Instagram for its made-up stories.""

Of course, some might question why Gossip Cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill. After all, they seem to rely on the images posted on Minaj's Instagram account as evidence that Meek and Minaj are still an item. One has to wonder if Gossip Cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond Instagram for stories.

Many will wonder why Minaj and Mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. The truth may lay in Minaj's hunger for publicity. According to Hip-Hop DX, Minaj was recently quoted as saying that Meek Mill's high-profile beefs with the like of Drake are great publicity. Perhaps Minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity.

The reality is that the public has no right to know anything about Mill and Minaj that the couple doesn't want shared publicly. It is easy to claim that Minaj and Mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. There is no doubt that artists like Minaj and Mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. Some claim this makes them ""fair game"" for the gossip columns.

The reality is that Nicki Minaj's sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or ""slut-shamed"" for it. The inner workings of Minaj's relationship with Meek Mill are no one's business but their own.

âThe Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is bred to be a companion,â she revealed about the breedâs behavior patterns. âI see that they are prone to separation anxiety because they bond very strongly with their humans. Theyâre essentially lap dogs, though they wouldnât quite fall into the Toy category. Carrying it with her everywhere will make it tough for it to leave her if she ever needs to leave the house because they do get very attached.â Selena was last spotted holding tight to her precious brown and white dog on Sept. 15, while leaving the Chelsea apartment she shares with her loving boyfriend.

2646,"Are Kendall, Kylie Jenner and Gigi, Bella Hadid headed for a nasty feud?

It looks like a case of siblings' war. Two of the most popular siblings' duo â Kendall, Kylie and Bella, Gigi â are reported to be on the verge of a nasty feud.

The shocking claim comes days after Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner were spotted attending Cannes and vacationing together. But what went wrong? It appears that the Jenner mother, Kris Jenner, is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute.

According to a report by Star, the Jenner sisters and Hadid sisters are at war and Kris Jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict. Apparently, mom-manager has designed a plan to make her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, the next ""it"" girls of the fashion industry by replacing the Hadid siblings.

A source told the gossip website that Kris is ""setting the stage"" for a nasty fight between the young models. The outlet also claims, ""[Kris] is hell-bent on getting a contract for either Kendall or Kylie with Tommy [Hilfiger], like Gigi currently has.""

Adding to the speculation, the source explained, ""The bottom line is the Hadid girls have that 'it' factor, but try telling Kris. She will stop at nothing to make sure her children succeed. She's determined to have her daughters in the top spot.""

The claims sound dubious considering the fact that all the four stars are successful in their respective ways and have been closest of friends. This led to Gossip Cop reaching out to their sources to find out if the claims are true. As it turns out, the Star's claims are not true.

Gossip Cop writes, ""Kendall and Kylie are not at ""war"" with Gigi and Bella, nor is the matriarch plotting to have her daughters overtake the Hadids in the fashion world. What's more, the four stars are actually the best of friends, and any claims made otherwise are completely unfounded. They're not in competition with each other, but extremely supportive of one another. There is no feud between the sister pairs, but just the opposite.""

It comes as no surprise that this claim was false considering the bond Kendall, Kylie, Bella and Gigi share.

Bella and Kendall, accompanied by Kylie, were recently seen at the New York Fashion Week together where Kendall turned photographer for Bella and took a beautiful picture of the Victoria's Secret model.

2551,"Brad Pitt Is Running Back to Jen Aniston During His Divorce From Angelina Jolie (EXCLUSIVE)

As Angelina Jolie continues to twist the knife in Brad Pitt's heart amid their impending divorce, the 53-year-old actor is running back to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston for support, In Touch has exclusively learned. A year after Angelina, 42, blindsided her husband of two years with divorce papers, the actress got candid with The New York Times, seemingly suggesting that her six children are better off without their father.

""[They're] the best friends I ever had,"" Angelina said of her children Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. ""Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.""

Aside from shading her ex-husband for his lack of support, Angelina also subtly implied that the kids are doing just fine, even without Brad. ""None of it's easy,"" she continued. ""It's very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy. They're getting better.""

Angelina's public talk of their marriage's demise and smearing of his parenting skills and reputation is enough to send Brad right into the arms of his ex, 48-year-old Friends star Jen. Though she married fellow actor Justin Theroux in 2015, Brad's former wife of nearly five years seems willing to be there for her ex-husband.

""[He] wants and needs Jen in his life,"" a source tells In Touch exclusively, ""especially during this trying time."" Justin, 46, isn't worried or the least bit threatened of Jen's friendship with her former beau. ""Brad wouldn't dream of breaking up Jen's marriage,"" the source reveals. ""Brad's leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed friendship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.""

""Overall, Brad and Jen have a great deal in common,"" another source says, ""and have reached a level of closeness and understanding that they never thought was possible.""But not everyone is comfortable with Brad and Jen's newfound kinship. Angelina has reportedly gotten wind of Brad's new confidante and is none too happy.

""She's furious,"" a source reveals of Angelina's reaction. ""Jen's always been Angelina's greatest rival when it comes to Brad. She hates the way that she has always been depicted as the evil femme fatale and Jen as the girl-next-door victim in the famous love triangle.""

Meanwhile, Jen is allegedly reveling in Angelina's sour reaction. ""She's getting her well-deserved revenge,"" says the source. ""Jen feels Angelina lorded her relationship with Brad over her all these years. Jen's having the last laugh. She loves the fact she has become his confidante.""

Exactly how Brad won over Jen as a friend is no real mystery. Earlier this year, he revealed his excessive binge-drinking to GQ â ""I was boozing too much,"" he said at the time â and has since decided to quit drinking and issue apologies to all those he wronged. Seeing as Jen ""was the person highest on his apology list,"" as the source says, he called her last June and offered his sincere regrets.

""Brad flat-out apologized for all the heartache and pain he caused by leaving her for Angelina,"" the source continues. ""He came off as genuinely sorry and Jen was deeply touched. She was completely won over.""

One more in-depth conversation was all it took to cement their friendship. Brad opened up to Jen about the infamous plane incident last year in which he allegedly got physical with Maddox while intoxicated. He also got candid about the custody battle that's still ranging on present-day.

""He soberly spoke about hitting rock bottom,"" the source says, ""and how he made the climb out. He launched into a grand apology. He apologized for being an absentee husband in the marriage â being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for being an avoider, getting lost and in a serious drinking-and-getting-high phase when he fell for Angelina while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""

The conversations re-instilled Jen's faith in Brad's sensitivity. In 2005, she infamously remarked that Brad was missing ""a sensitivity chip."" But it seems with these recent, heart-felt dialogues, his chip has been restored in Jen's eyes.

""He told Jen they might still even be married if he were emotionally and physically present and sober at the time,"" the source says. ""It was the most intimate conversation Brad had ever had with Jen.""

The rekindled friendship could even spark some future collaboration. ""Brad wants her involved again,"" says the source, ""and Jen wants in on such prestige projects.""

""Jen has a way of calming and encouraging Brad, which he needs in his hectic life right now,"" the source continues. ""He's in a great place mentally and physically. He's in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before. He is closer to the kids than he has been in months, and he's shown tremendous maturity and patience with Angelina concerning the divorce.""

While Kathy Griffin continues her sympathy crusade after weathering a storm of criticism for her terrible Trump severed-head photo, sources say sheâs seething about how Anderson Cooper dropped her from his CNN New Yearâs Eve broadcast like a hot potato.

Sources said Griffin had expected CNN âgolden boyâ Cooper to stand by her, but the news network swiftly announced she was fired from the NYE broadcast with Cooper, which theyâve done together for 10 years.

TV insiders say respected newsman Cooper had no choice but to condemn Griffinâs disturbing photoshoot, in which she held up a faux severed and bloody head of President Trump.

After the controversial image of Griffin went viral, sparking widespread backlash, Cooper tweeted, âFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.â

But a source said, âKathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.â Griffin appeared in a tearful press conference Friday where she sobbed of Trump: âHe broke me.â No word about Cooper.

The buzz at CNN is that Cooper could use the opportunity of Griffinâs firing to bring his longtime buddy, Bravoâs âWatch What Happens Liveâ star Andy Cohen, into his NYE broadcast. Cohen also hosts âLove Connectionâ on Fox.

The source said, âAnderson wants Andy to co-host with him. They are already doing a multi-city tour together, they are besties and have a great rapport.â Cohen revealed that they were set up on a blind date in the early â90s, but Cooper says Cohen blew it during their initial phone call by being âtoo enthusiastic.â They were later introduced by mutual friends in LA and their platonic bromance blossomed.

But sources add that Cohen âmay have some contractual problems to overcomeâ with Bravo before he can appear on CNN with Cooper.

Reps for Bravo, Cohen and CNN declined to comment.

2559,"Tom Hiddleston Stunned Taylor Swift Referenced Him On New Album: Hereâs Why

While most of the people who are or were in Taylor Swiftâs life most likely knew theyâd be called out on her album, Tom Hiddleston thought he was safe! But, is ex mentioned him in TWO tracks! Hereâs what he thinks â¦


Tom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, âReputationâ. But, come on, Tom; anyoneâs fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks â âI Did Something Badâ and âGetaway Carâ. And, since the pair didnât split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he wouldâve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.

âTom was not expecting to be a part of Taylorâs album,â a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. âHe thought they were on good terms,â our insider says, adding, âAfter their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyoneâs saying she did and heâs stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.â Well, maybe next time, Tom.

As soon as Taylorâs sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, hereâs what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, âI Did Something Badâ, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a ânarcissistâ who âtalks sh-t.â Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a âplayboyâ who she flew âaround the worldâ with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.

The second Tom reference on âReputationâ came on the track, âGetaway Carâ, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesnât have a âreason.â Then, when she goes to an event where âthe ties were black and the lights were white,â she found her reason â a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Galaâ¦ the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didnât work out, and that the person [Tom] shouldâve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.

Taylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogueâs editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Tyga owes his ex-sugar mama Kylie Jenner millions of dollars! ""Kylie had been bankrolling Tyga for well over a year and she's finding herself short on cash as a result,"" an insider revealed.

The reality teen quickly got a harsh lesson in fiscal responsibility when she ""begged"" him to start paying her back.

""He was shocked when she asked to be paid, telling her he thought the money was a gift, not a loan,"" the insider said. ""He's a total loser and owes her over $2 million.""

However, 26-year-old Tyga's shock was nowhere near the surprise Kris Jenner got when her 18-year-old daughter broke the news.

""Kylie had no choice but to admit it all to Kris, who absolutely hit the roof,"" said the insider. ""She threatened to go after him if Kylie didn't ditch him.""

""She was always helping him, paying his legal bills when he was getting out of his record contract and she funding most of his latest album, which flopped,"" continued the insider.

""Kris now wants her on an accountancy course because she's obviously completely clueless about money.""

2579,"Jim Carrey On Another Planet! Thinks Alien Reptiles Rule Earth

Comic Jim Carrey is secretly a follower of a kooky conspiracy nut who believes alien reptiles run the world! Even nuttier, the Dumb and Dumber star plans to go public with his commitment to whack job David Ickeâs bizarre theory!

âIcke has spent years wooing Jim, and itâs finally paid off. Jim is now a disciple of this guy!â claimed a source.

The crazy coupling helps explain Carreyâs bizarre behavior during New York Fashion Week when he declared he âdidnât exist.â

Icke, a 65-year-old former soccer player, is a British broadcaster and author who frequently raves about the Illuminati, the legendary secret society aimed at global domination and populated by the alien reptiles.

When confronted about his screwy convictions, Icke said: âFor 26 years I have taken untold fâking sât and ridicule from people who donât know their arse from their elbow. I didnât and I donât have any regrets!â

An insider tattled: âJimâs into all of Ickeâs weird theories. Heâs studied his speeches and dispatches to the very last letter.â

âHe goes to as many of Ickeâs public appearances as he can â often in disguise â to avoid any attention,â continued the insider. âHeâs mesmerized by everything Icke says!â

Insiders told Radar The Mask star wants Ickeâs unhinged gospel spread to the masses â and his way-out Fashion Week outburst may be the first sign of more manic preaching to come.

âItâs a big reason why Jim ranted on the red carpet,â the source spilled.

âIf you thought he was crazy before, you ainât seen nothing yet!â

According to a new report by E! Online, Brad Pitt is still in communication with his ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston. A source tells the outlet that the pair - who divorced in 2005 - have a ""friendly, but limited relationship"" with one another.

The confirmation comes shortly after Us Weekly reported that the Allied star, 53, has ""been texting"" his former wife, 48, amid his ongoing divorce proceedings from estranged wife Angelina Jolie, 41.
An insider says that Brad didn't have the former Friends star's contact information, but tracked down her cell phone number through a ""tangled web"" of mutual friends in order to wish her a happy birthday on Feb. 11. His birthday well wishes sparked a conversation between the exes.

2563,"Mariah Careyâs manager was always hungry for fame

Long before she managed Mariah Carey, Stella Bulochnikov was a standup comedian.

Going by her married name, Stella Stolper, the tough-talking Russian native competed on Season 4 of âLast Comic Standingâ while pregnant with her second child.

In a clip from an episode that aired June 20, 2006, she jokes about her pregnancy, telling the crowd, âI love the babies! I want to have more kids, really, I do! I just canât take the pain, and the nausea and all that weight. And Iâm not talking about the nine months of being pregnant, Iâm talking about the two minutes the old manâs on top of me.â

Why Mariah Carey's manager is more like a 'dictator'
Unfortunately for Bulochnikov, the audience couldnât take her jokes: She was voted off in the same episode.

Her efforts at comedy stardom may lend credence to rumors that Bulochnikov, an experienced TV producer and the mastermind behind âMariahâs World,â is eager for her own fame.

âStella is the one who really wants to be the reality star. She even filmed a pilot for herself last year,â an insider who used to work with the self-proclaimed âRussian dictatorâ previously told Page Six. âThis will likely be more of a TV launching vehicle for her. Itâs going to be like the Stella show, which is what sheâs always wanted. She is definitely very much out for herself, and this is a golden opportunity for her because she wants to be famous. She wants to be the one in the magazines.â

The source added, âStella is the furthest thing from a manager. Sheâs a TV producer. Sheâs practically moved in with Mariah and now she has so much stuff on her that she can get her to do anything. Sheâs pulling the strings, and Mariah does whatever she says.â

Country firecracker Miranda Lambert has broken her âno contact policyâ with ex Blake Shelton â to tell him sheâs set to wed again!

âMiranda has refused to speak to Blake since their divorce,â dished a source. âBut sheâs happy to hit him with the news that sheâs fully ready to replace him!â

The âCrazy Ex-Girlfriendâ singer has been showing off her intended â boy-toy singer Anderson East â whenever thereâs a camera around.

She even seemed to announce wedding plans at the Academy of Country Music Awards in April, when she showed up in a jaw-dropping, white bridal-style gown with Anderson on her arm.

Adding to Mirandaâs glee, Blake and his main squeeze, Gwen Stefani, skipped the event.

As The National ENQUIRER has reported, Miranda froze out Blake after he wasted no time hooking up with his fellow judge on âThe Voice.â

âIt infuriated Miranda that Blake started dating this gorgeous pop star before the ink was even dry on their divorce papers,â a close pal of Miranda tattled to The ENQUIRER.

Refusing to let any grass grow under her boot heels, Miranda began dating Anderson in December 2015, five months after splitting with Blake.

In September, Miley Cyrus told The Sun on Sunday that she and her fiancÃ© Liam Hemsworth had no wedding plans anytime soon. ""I donât envision marriage,"" she told The Sun on Sunday. ""Iâm 24. I hope to get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married]."" (Her mother Tish Cyrus made the same point when asked about a rumored Miley-Liam elopement in June, too.)

But, if this wild rumor from Australiaâs NW Magazine is true (via The Sun and The Daily Mail), the lack of wedding plans may just be because Cyrus and Hemsworth already had their wedding. In April. A source told the outlet that ""six months ago, way back in late April,"" the two secretly had ""a very intimate ceremony at their house in Malibu. I'm told only a handful of people were there and they're still the only ones who know."" Hmâ¦

Cyrus was first spotted wearing a wedding band-like ring in July.

She was recently photographed with Hemsworth wearing her band with her engagement ring:

Hemsworth was first photographed with one in August.

But People reports these are just promise rings. ""He [Liam] wears that ring as more of a 'promise' to Miley, but they are not officially married,"" a source told E! in August when Hemsworth's ring first debuted. ""The only thing that is missing is the legal piece of paper. The pair is not focused on planning a wedding at this time. They are more focused on making their love as strong as possible.""

But, given Hemsworth also publicly denied being engaged to Cyrus when Cyrus was probably engaged to him and definitely wearing his engagement ring in April 2016, only those two really know whatâs going on.

The news marks the end of a tumultuous year in which Cyrus, 20, and Hemsworth, 23, have experienced more break-ups than bonding moments.

The couple â who first met on the movie set of 2010's The Last Song â got engaged in May 2012. At the time, the singer told PEOPLE, ""I'm so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with Liam.""

But earlier this year, the pair decided to postpone their wedding.

Cyrus was subsequently seen out without her 3.5-carat Neil Lane engagement ring but soon it was back on her hand and the couple were reunited in July in Canada, where Hemsworth was shooting his new movie Cut Bank, and on the red carpet for his movie Paranoia in August.

Since then the couple seem to have been living separate lives as the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer continues to plug her album Bangerz and Hemsworth prepares to promote Catching Fire.

Reps for both stars had no further comment.

Taylor Swift Goes Naked in '...Ready for It?' Music Video Teaser

Nope, definitely not ready for this! Taylor Swift released a 15-second teaser for the music video for her new song ââ¦Ready for It?â on Monday, October 23.

In the clip, the Grammy winner, 27, struts down a hallway with a hood covering her head. She then turns into a badass robot and fights off a group of bad guys. Oh, and sheâs completely naked during it all (or at least wearing a nude-colored bodysuit). The intense preview is filled with lightning, magic and action, and casts her in a dark, superhero-like light.

ââ¦Ready For It? Official Music Video out Thursday night. #ReadyForItMusicVideo,â she captioned the teaser on all of her social media accounts.

Swift released ââ¦Ready for Itâ on September 3, just a few days after premiering âLook What You Made Me Do,â the lead single from her upcoming sixth studio album, Reputation. The electronic song, which was first teased during a Sunday Night Football broadcast, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it Swiftâs 22nd song to land in the top 10.

The âShake It Offâ singer later released a love song titled âGorgeousâ on Friday, October 20 â and she has plenty more on the way. A source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month that Reputation âchronicles her feudsâ with longtime foes Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry and ex Calvin Harris. âIt will be across multiple songs, somewhat cryptically, but also obvious,â the insider told Us.

It looks like Kristen Stewart won't have any time on her hands to make another 'Twilight' movie with Robert Pattinson in the near future. In fact, new reports indicate that the Hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller, 'Underwater.'

According to Deadline, the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake. Kristen will star as Noah, a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember. And while there have been reports suggesting that Kristen might reunite with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson for another 'Twilight' film, at this point it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

Then again, many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another 'Twilight' movie made again is because Robert Pattinson doesn't want to work with Kristen Stewart again. After all, she absolutely humiliated him right before their break-up in 2012. Robert was devastated when he found out that Kristen was having a secret affair with director Rupert Sanders behind his back. His trust issues with Kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again.

Plus, Robert Pattinson has moved on with FKA Twigs. He doesn't want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life. Meanwhile, Kristen is dating model Stella Maxwell. The last thing Robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend. He wants to concentrate on his Hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life.

But for Kristen Stewart, she doesn't feel that way. She loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines. She even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another 'Twilight' movie if the script and timing were both right. She even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it, too.

Chrisâ comment follows the praise the 33-year-old had for Charlize back in April when he said: âSheâs incredibleâ¦Sheâs one of my favourites.â

Even KIISFM host Kyle Sandilands noticed the admiration Chris had for Charlize pointing out they havenât worked together in four years âand the guyâs still talking about her. I bet that wife has a problemâ¦â

However, Chris and Elsa both regularly gush about their relationship.

The couple relocated their family to Byron Bay a few years ago and their romance seem to be better than ever.

They have been married for seven years after meeting in 2010 and tying the knot just months later.

Chris and Elsa have three kids together five-year-old India and three-year-old twins Sasha and Tristan.

2461,"'Jessie J's 100% gay ... but bi is more trendy'

POP beauty Jessie J is 100 per cent lesbian, an explosive book claims.

The Voice judge, 24, was ordered to hide the truth by record bosses to avoid

 turning off male fans, the unauthorised biography says.

They advised the star to say she was a bisexual who liked boys AND

 girls, because that was trendy.

But the sensational book alleges the singer-songwriter has not had a

 boyfriend since realising she was a lesbian at 17.

The book, Jessie J: Who's Laughing Now, says Jessie took the advice of music

 executives because she was scared of losing her Universal record deal.

Author Chloe Govan says: ""Jessie might have been with boys in the past - but

 she is 100 per cent gay. Jessie was openly lesbian and didn't hide it.

""She was advised not to come out, though. Certain people thought being bi was

 trendy, exotic and a fashion statement. It would increase her allure.

""Being gay would alienate people. They knew how important image was and asked

 her to tone it down a bit.

""There are so many homophobes out there, they feared a career-damaging

 backlash.""

Jessie - who admits fancying fellow singer Rihanna - is said to have been

 ""incensed"" at having to compromise.

She said in a recent interview: ""If I meet someone and I like them, I don't

 care if they're a boy or a girl.""

The book, out today, also talks about Jessie's battles with her health and

 bullying she faced.

When she was 11 she learned she had the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White

 syndrome. It can speed up the heart rate to four times normal.

Jessie had a stroke aged 18 but never let her illness get in the way of her

 ambitions.

She even took ballet lessons while wearing a heart monitor.

She was also prescribed beta blockers - but was picked on when their side

 effects turned her pale skin a greenish tinge.

WhenÂ George and Amal Clooney celebrated their wedding for a second time on Oct. 25, there was once again two very noticeable guests missing -Â Brad Pitt andÂ Angelina Jolie were nowhere to be seen!

And while he and Angelina were, indeed, filmingÂ By the Sea during the original Sept. 27 nuptials, a source close to their family says there's more to the absence than just work commitment. ""They were invited and Brad gave George his word he'd be there,"" the insider explains. ""But Angie vetoed the trip at the last minute. She wanted to pull a power play and dis Amal.""

Both women are invested in humanitarian work, but the first time they crossed paths, in London on June 12, Angie made it clear that Amal was persona non grata - and even blew her off when Amal requested a public greeting in front of photographers. ""Angie feels competitive with Amal,"" the source reveals. ""She has been running from her past for years, and although she's done a fabulous job reinventing herself, she continues to feel like an uneducated outsider.""

Jennifer Aniston, 47, has dreamed of becoming a mom for a long time - is she finally getting her wish? Maybe! After all, according to a new report, the actress is expecting her first child with husband Justin Theroux, 44. But are Jen and Justin ACTUALLY about to become new parents? The answer may surprise you!

""She's pregnant,"" a reported friend of the couple revealed toÂ InTouch magazine. ""She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years. Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too - she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.""

However, we have spoken to Jennifer's rep directly and we've been told that Jennifer is NOT pregnant and the entire story is ""fabricated."" Aw, we can't say we're not disappointed though. Jennifer and Justin WOULD make fantastic parents!

But nonetheless, whileÂ vacationing in the Bahamas on a romantic getaway, Jennifer and Justin allegedly looked like the perfect couple. Flaunting their PDA, the two definitely seemed more in love than ever - talk about the perfect vacay. Justin was also allegedly super attentive to his wife, aw!

""The baby has turned him from a guy who didn't seem like he was meant for marriage into beyond supportive,"" the mag's insider dished. ""He was by Jen's side as she dealt with the death of her mom, and he's been waiting on her hand and food in the early days of the pregnancy.""

And while we know now that Jennifer is NOT actually pregnant, we still love seeing this couple get along. It seems like their romantic trip is helping them get closer than everÂ - and we are ALL for that!

Witnesses did claim that Jennifer refrained from drinking alcohol and smoking while on the island. ""She's dealing with exhaustion and experiencing morning sickness,"" the magazine's insider gushed. ""She's put on about 10 pounds so far."" But honestly, people's weights have a tendency to fluctuate - so just because Jennifer may have gained some weight, doesn't mean she's pregnant.

2466,"Tory ministers have saved an iconic gay bar once visited by Princess Diana

One of Britain's most famous gay bars which Princess Diana reportedly visited with Freddie Mercury was today given listed building status.

The iconic Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which featured in last year's hit film Pride about the 1984-5 Miners' Strike and where Lily Savage once started a riot, was given Grade II protection.

The 153-year-old pub - one of Britain's most famous gay bars and close to spy agency MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross - has been at the centre of a planning row after being sold to property developers last year.

But the listing will make it much more difficult to close the bar and build flats - and is a victory for the RVT Future campaign.

Founder Amy LamÃ© said: ""The listing is a fantastic milestone for our community and a victory against the odds for our beloved pub.

""We look forward to continuing our work to ensure the RVT remains a vibrant space of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community and culture for generations to come.""

The pub has a rich and colourful history.

Princess Diana was allegedly disguised as a male model and smuggled into the venue in the late 1980s.

Queen singer Freddie and comedians Cleo Rocos and Kenny Everett dressed Diana in an army jacket, cap and sunglasses for a night out at the south London pub.

Lily Savage once started a riot at the RVT when it was raided by cops in 1984.

And it featured in the smash hit movie Pride, which told the story of how a group of striking Welsh miners received the unusual backing of a group of lesbian and gay activists from London's emerging gay scene, with the pub acting as a backdrop.

The RVT's supporters include TV host Graham Norton and Lord of the Rings star Sir Ian McKellen.

Historic England's Director of Listing Roger Bowdler said: ""The Royal Vauxhall Tavern is an enduring and important venue for the LGB&T community.

""Built on the site of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, it carries on the tradition of alternative and bohemian entertainment which is bound up in this part of London's history and identity.""

Heritage Minister Tracey Crouch said: ""I am thrilled to be able to list the Royal Vauxhall Tavern as Grade II - the iconic cultural hub in the heart of London is of huge significance to the LGB&T community.

""Not only of architectural interest, the venue has a longstanding historic role as a symbol of tolerance and alternative entertainment.""

""Residing in Lambeth since 1860, the landmark venue has been the springboard for so many of our loved UK entertainers.

""I am delighted that the listing will preserve the history of this venue for future generations to enjoy. I hope that it continues to be filled with laughter and joy.""

2613,"EXCLUSIVE PICS: First photos of Ariana Grande since Manchester attack

An emotional Ariana Grande was spotted for the first time since the terror attack at her Manchester concert on Monday as she touched down in her hometown of Boca Raton, Florida.

The pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on Tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend Mac Miller, who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the 23-year-old singer.

Ariana, who was dressed in head-to-toe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie, shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with Miller before being whisked away in an SUV caravan to a family member's home in a nearby gated community.

Miller could also been seen warmly embracing Ariana's mother Joan, who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black, and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles.

Police cars were also seen surrounding Joan's nearby home, less than 24 hours after 22 people lost their lives and another 119 were injured when a improvised device went off inside Manchester Arena just moments after Ariana performed her final song.

Joan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on Monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos.

Rather than panic however, she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage, where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem.

Ariana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack, but did post a message on Twitter early Tuesday, writing: 'broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.'

The pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her much-anticipated European tour, which kicked off in Stockholm on May 8 and was set to wrap up on June 15 in Rome.

She and Joan made a quick and quiet departure from England early Tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star Taylor Swift, who lent the two women one of her private jets.Â Sources told TMZ,Â however, that Swift wasn't involved in the process, as the private jet was financed down the middle by Grande's touring corporation Live Nation and manager Scooter Braun.

ISIS is now taking credit for the Monday night massacre, with authorities identifying 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage.

The blast from Abedi's improvised devise went off just seconds after Ariana finished her final song of the evening, with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts.

Abedi is the British-born son of Libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where Ariana performed on Monday.

Police are still investigating whether or not Abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack, and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack.

That individual, who is 23, has not yet been identified by police.

Investigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on Monday by Ariana's young fans and the arena's surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out.

Prime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical, meaning an attack could happen imminently in Britain.

If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005.

Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.

One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said 'Thank you, Manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion.

The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.

Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.

City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident Â while Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.

The names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing Ariana perform live for the first time.

Eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. Even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother Lisa still has no ideaÂ as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life.

Saffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack.

Georgina Callander, 18, lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at Ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert.

Two years prior, Georgina had got to go backstage and meet Grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star.

Saffie and Georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of Tarleton, and on Tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short.

Some carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'I LOVE MCR.'

With the whole of Britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming June 6 election our of respect for the victims.

A number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of Monday night's attack.

David Beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for Manchester United, posted on Facebook: 'Heartbreaking news from Manchester. As a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. My thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...'

His Spice Girl-turned designer wife Victoria, who lived in Manchester after marrying Beckham, added: 'My heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in Manchester last night.'

Swift, who later offered up her private jet to Ariana, wrote:Â 'My thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the Manchester tragedy tonight. I'm sending all my love.'

Katy Perry also commented on the violent attack, saying:Â 'Praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... Broken hearted for the families tonight. Broken hearted for Ari. Broken hearted for the state of this world.'

And Rihanna wrote: 'Manchester has always been so close to my heart! These are innocent vulnerable kids, this could've been any of us! I'm devastated!

'Praying for the beautiful souls we lost, their families and loved ones, for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this #Manchester.'

One of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from British-born talk show host James Corden, who was taping his late night program in Los Angeles when the attack occurred on Monday.

'It shocks me every time we hear this sort of news, that attacks like this can happen, but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight.

'Many of you won't have ever been to Manchester, but you will definitely have heard of it. It's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, Man City, Man United. It's famous for incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division.

'It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. It's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character.

'But when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find.

'Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.

'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff of the MEN arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, Ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. We'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.'

Mel Gibson: Hollywood Pedophiles Have Nowhere Left To Hide

Mel Gibson says that the sexual abuse scandal in HollywoodÂ is going to get worse, claiming that tinsel town pedophiles have ânowhere left to hide.â

Speaking at the Dublin premiere of his new film Daddyâs Home 2, the star was asked by Newstalk Breakfastâs Henry McKean about the current atmosphere in Hollywood.

Newstalk.com reports:Â Gibson said that he hopes there will be a positive outcome for victims of sexual harassment or assault who are now coming forward.

He said: âI think a lot of lightâs being shined into a lot of dark places right now â and rightfully so.

âItâs tragic in a sense, because a lot of the poor victims have to relive it. [Itâs] torturous for them â but theyâll get free by re-examining it.â

Gibsonâs career stalled in 2006 when he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, and was recorded making anti-Semitic remarks following the arrest.

After a half-decade off screens, Gibson has made a gradual comeback in recent years â culminating in several Oscar nominations, including Best Film and Best Director, for his most recent directorial effort Hacksaw Ridge.

Talking about his own comeback, he simply said: âYou just donât stop breathing.â

2471,"Does Madonna Want To Send Rebellious Rocco To Military School?

The reason why Madonna's son Rocco bolted for his father's home is becoming clearer. It seems that Madonna is a bit more strict at home than one would imagine, and she wants to send son Rocco to military school. Rocco Ritchie, 15, does not want to go, and while on tour with Madonna, he ran off to live with his father.

According to the Inquisitr, Madonna says that Guy Ritchie is trash-talking her to Rocco, but Rocco insists that his mother is controlling and uses him as a trophy. Also, rather than being in school in New York, he is dragged along on her tour and put to work. He has had enough and wants to live with his father. This is a struggle that many divorced parents face, but Madonna feels that she is above this and went right to a judge, but Rocco is refusing to come back to the U.S.

Radar Online is reporting that Madonna is taking her controlling manner to a new level by trying to get Rocco into military school.

""Madonna is a very good mother, but she's mega controlling,"" a source close to the pop icon, 57, told Radar. ""She actively tells him what he can and can't do, who he can and can't talk to.""

But Madonna thinks that military school will straighten Rocco out, but Rocco wants a normal life with Guy Ritchie in the U.K.

""He's not being dragged around like a dancing puppet [when he's in London],"" a source told the publication. ""He can meet his friends, eat fast food, he doesn't have an early curfew. The story is his father manipulated him, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Rocco has a life and friends [in the U.K.] and he can have girlfriends and be in one place.""

The judge had ruled that Rocco should be back by Christmas but is now insisting that he is back before school starts in January

The New York Daily News has mentioned that Madonna is a meddling mama, and Rocco is over it. A source says that life in London is easier for Rocco at this point in his life.

Madonna thinks she can provide a better life for Rocco, and that Guy Ritchie's life is boring.

""(Madonna) is impossible to work with and impossible to live with for a 15-year-old boy. He has no freedom under her. She tells him he's going away to school,"" says the source. ""His life (in London) is not strict, he's not Madonna's son, he's more like a regular teen. Guy lives a very normal life, Rocco is not on movie sets, if he doesn't want to be there.""

Rocco desperately wants to enroll in school in London and come back to New York in the future to visit. Over the weekend, Rocco was seen skateboarding around the Ritchie neighborhood and simply hanging out with friends.

There is no indication whether Rocco plans to return to New York for a hearing with the judge or if he will fight it from London with his father.

Do you think it would be best if Madonna would just give Rocco time with his father?

Khloe seems readier than ever to settle down and start a family. As Radar reported, sheâs shelling out big bucks planning a wedding with NBA hoopster Tristan Thompson, even though he hasnât yet proposed.

âSheâs set aside half a million bucks, which she figures will pay for at least half the ceremony as well as dresses, catering, entertainment and a five-star honeymoon,â said a source.

Khloe also been showering Thompson with all kinds of fancy and expensive gifts, including jewelry and luxury trips, to keep him from splitting, said one insider.

At 32, her biological clock is ticking away, making taking care of Dream her backup plan, the insider said.

âKhloe does want babies of her own one day, but she wants to be a significant part of Dreamâs life,â the source claimed. âSheâs totally in love with that little girl!â

2475,"'Girl' Fight! Kanye West Confronts Anna Wintour Over Putting Lena Dunham On 'Vogue' Cover Instead Of FiancÃ©e Kim Kardashian

Too big for your designed sneakers, Kanye?Â During a recent power lunch at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge, theÂ hip hop star demanded answers from VogueÂ Editor-In-Chief Anna WintourÂ to the question: Why did she judge GirlsÂ star Lena DunhamÂ as being cover worthy for the famed fashion bible, while his fiance, Kim Kardashian, has long been overlooked?

Kanye, 36, insisted to the British-born fashion icon that Kim is ""just as talented as Lena, if not more so,"" one source revealed to Radar.

""Kanye thinks that Kim has a much bigger fan base and appeal than Lena,"" said the insider.

""To Kanye, it's insulting that his friend Anna is still refusing to even consider putting Kim on the cover of Vogue. He thinks Anna is listening to a bunch of 'know-nothing' corporate haters, as he put it. He's upset that Anna isn't willing to do him this personal favor and put Kim on the cover.

""Kanye knows that it's always been a huge dream of Kim's to be on the Vogue cover and Kanye wants to make it comes true. If nothing else, Kanye is persistent.""

PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Slammed The Kardashians

During an interview with Ryan SeacrestÂ last year, Kanye declared: ""There is no way Kim Kardashian shouldn't be on the cover of Vogue. She is the most intriguing woman right now. She has got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday.""

The father-of-one may still has some work to do, however.

Last May,Â in a fashion slap heard around the world, VogueÂ editors cropped Kim out of its ""Best Dressed"" gallery when she appeared with West on the Met Ball red carpet in Manhattan, wearing the now infamous and universally pannedÂ floral printÂ ensemble.

What's more, during Kanye's recent concert tour stop in Brooklyn, Wintour chose not to sit next to the E! starlet, despite being in the same VIP box.

""Anna is no fan of Kim or any reality star appearing in the pages of the magazine,"" one spy previously told Radar.

There is one consolation for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star:Â Wintour is ""open to the idea"" of having Kardashian, 33, appearÂ on the cover of the French or Italian edition of the magazine, a source confirmed.

""She hopes that will get Kanye off of her back,"" said the insider.

""There would still be some backlash if Anna allowed that to happen, but not as much if Kim were to appear on the U.S. edition.""

Jamie Foxx is reportedly teaching Katie Holmes' daughter Suri how to play the piano.

The 49-year-old star is thought to have dated Katie, 38, since 2013 and the couple went public with their romance earlier this month.

It has now been claimed that Foxx has been helping 11-year-old Suri - Katie's child with ex-husband Tom Cruise - master the keys and the pair are bonding over their mutual love of the instrument.

A source told the new issue of America's Star magazine: ""He's a great teacher and it's giving them a hobby to bond over. He makes the lessons fun and he's not pushy, which works for Suri. She loves to practice, and Katie couldn't be happier.""

Foxx - who has two daughters, 23-year-old model Corrine and eight-year-old Annalise - began learning the piano when he was just five years old and by the time he was a teenager he was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church in Texas.

He has carried his musical talents and passion through to his career, releasing five albums and collaborating with other artists, including rapper Kanye West on his 2005 smash hit 'Gold Digger'.

Foxx famously portrayed soul and jazz legend Ray Charles in the 2004 biopic 'Ray', and his portrayal of the singer-and-pianist earned him the Best Actor Oscar.

2532,"Allison Williamsâ top-secret wedding revealed

Allison Williams is getting married on Saturday in a starry secret ceremony out west, Page Six can exclusively reveal.

The âGirlsâ star will wed CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen in front of guests including her father, Brian Williams, plus Bruce Springsteen, Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller, and Williamsâ âGirlsâ castmates Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet and Jemima Kirke.

Also expected are Seth Meyers and his wife Alexi Ashe, Bee Shaffer, Andy Cohen, Tom Hanks â who may even officiate at the wedding, according to a source â and his wife Rita Wilson, who plays Williamsâ mother on âGirls.â

The source told us, âThe wedding is being kept so secret that guests are being asked to fly to Denver, where they will be picked up and taken to the location, which is thought to be somewhere in Wyoming.

âThe accommodations for all guests are being paid for and then many of the guests are flying to LA together for Sundayâs Emmys.â

Williams, 27, who has been engaged to Van Veen, 34, since February 2014, delayed her wedding plans due to the scandal which engulfed her newsman father, which saw him stepping down as anchor of NBCâs âNightly Newsâ earlier this year after he exaggerated stories about his bravery in situations including the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina.

She said in February during a Q&A with âLate Nightâ host Meyers at the 92Y, âThis has been a really hard time. Obviously [itâs] toughest on my dad, who is sort of bearing the full burden of the responsibility for it â¦ Current events started happening so that derailed [wedding plans] a little bit.â

After a six-month suspension, Brian Williams is due to make his return to TV, this time on MSNBC, next Tuesday, where he will be a breaking news anchor and will initially report on the Popeâs visit. It is believed he delayed his return to TV until after his daughterâs hush-hush wedding.

A rep for Alison Williams didnât immediately get back to us.

2476,"Harry Styles Leaving One Direction Behind For Kendall Jenner?

In December, Harry StylesÂ left hisÂ One DirectionÂ bandmates in Paris to meetÂ Kendall JennerÂ for a romantic one-night rendezvous in London. At the time it seemed like a romantic gesture, but it may have been a foreboding sign of things to come. The two starsÂ have been getting closer and closer, and the hot and heavy relationship is reportedly taking a serious toll on 1D.

Harry is starting to fall hard, and it's reportedly making him want to spend all of his time with Kendall instead of the band.

""Kendall's a sweet girl, but [the band] sees her as a bigger threat thanÂ Taylor SwiftÂ ever was,"" a source toldÂ OK! magazine. ""She seems to have cast a spell over Harry and it's disrupting other areas of his life because he's always wanting to spend time with her or chat with her on the phone when they're apart. It's causing a lot of unrest.""

Worse than Taylor - now that's saying something! But that assessment might actually be spot on - Kendall's reportedly causing so much tension within 1D that the boys' arguments are actually getting physical! ""The other day, Harry and Niall [Horan] almost came to blows when Niall confronted Harry when he showed up late for a meeting,"" the same source said. ""Things got out of hand beforeÂ ZaynÂ [Malik] stepped in to break them up.""

Guys! Don't you know it's supposed to be bros before hoes?!

Rumors about 1D splitting apart crop up almost on a daily basis, but this one seems to have more legs because Harry and Kendall really have been heating up. And it wouldn't be the first time that a sexy girlfriend got in between a band.

But hopefully claims of Kendall's negative influence on Harry and One Direction are overstated - and if not, we hope the guys of 1D will be able to work out whatever animosity has developed, and the lovestruck Harry can refocus on making music.

2488,"Robert Pattinson Recovering From Alleged Drinking Problem - Realized Substance Abuse Would Tank Career! | Celeb Dirty Laundry

According to recent reports and hints dropped by Hollywood sources, Robert Pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. It would certainly explain why he's been hanging out with Zac Efron, of all people. We already know Zac isn't known for his sobriety, and Rob has been partying quite a lot lately.

Star Magazine's source claims, ""Rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup withÂ Kristen [Stewart], and he turned to alcohol to numb it all.Â He drank a lot every night, and even during filming. But his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles.""

Is this so hard to believe? Daniel Radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. Clearly, something about all these YA franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with Rob's situation, he's always been a social drinker â maybe a little too much.

He's admitted to drinking before auditions, and he's usually photographed at bars or parties these days. Even if his vice isn't alcohol, plenty of people have said that Rob's had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven't technically been proven yet.

And trust me, they won't be. Rob's people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won't go to the press with this. And if Star's source is right, then he's already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. Alcohol doesn't do the best things to people's faces or bodies, and it's not like Rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks. Sorry Twi-hards, but you know it's true.

Liza Minnelli's sad life has taken one tragic turn after another - and it's finally gotten the best of the beleaguered star!

The Academy Awardâwinning actress and singer has waged a desperate battle against drugs and booze her entire life, as well as a slew of devastating health problems. Now, RadarOnline.com has learned that her friends fear for her life.

Minnelli, who just turned 70, has suffered a shocking relapse and is back to her old habits, claimed a spy.

In September, she sold her luxe New York apartment, where she had resided for more than a decade. Minnelli is currently living in a rented Los Angeles home and is controlled by her assistants, claimed the insider.

The latest drama comes after she recorded a bizarre message in which she seemed to be bidding farewell to close pals and adoring fans.

""I wouldn't be who I am without you, any of you, and on top of that, I just remember all of the goodness and all of the kind wishes and the support and the friendship,"" she said in the message, released shortly after her March 12 birthday.

Strangely, she concluded with, ""Thank you very, very much. I'll never ever forget you.""

""It was chilling listening to it,"" one longtime Hollywood insider told Radar after hearing the message. ""Liza sounded like she was saying farewell. It was just heartbreaking. People have to be worried. You just have to wonder if she has three months left.""

As Radar previously reported last April, a killer combo of alcohol and prescription pills landed the Cabaret star in a Malibu rehab center. She has ""spiraled out of control"" after a painful new back injury, which she sought help for in her fifth rehab stint, dished a source.

While Minnelli's rep denies she's dying, her health woes have been numerous. She had two hip replacements, contracted double pneumonia in 2000, battled viral encephalitis a few months later, broke a kneecap in 2003, fractured her wrist in three places in a 2013 tumble and underwent back surgery the following year.

""Liza has been through so much,"" lamented the spy. ""You just have to wonder how much more she can take. People are worried about her. Right now, all we can do is pray.""

About a year ago, the Spice Girls were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their single ""Wannabe."" The single, which, despite being the group's first, managed to hit the top of the charts in almost every country it was released, set the precedent for the quintet to be one of the biggest musical forces of their time â a destiny that was fulfilled tenfold.

To celebrate the monumental anniversary, three of the group's membersâMel B (Scary Spice), Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice)âall climbed into bed together to record a special thank you video for the fans. Casually mentioning a ""special party"" that the fans ""are all invited"" to, the members also slyly hinted at an upcoming reunion.

Later, the members announced that they would be touring the following year, with a special concert slotted for London's historic Hyde Park. Though Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) have both assured the public that they had no plans to join the other three in the reunion, it seemed like the trio (which rebranded as GEM) was still determined to power forward.

Unfortunately, a pregnancy for Geri put the reunion plans on an indefinite hiatus â but even after the singer gave birth to her child in January, there was still no word on when the group would get the ball rolling again. Now, according to a report in Page Six, we have official confirmation that the reunion is back in the works thanks to Mel B's impending divorce from her soon-to-be ex-husband Stephen Belafonte. According to the report, Belafonte's ""controlling influence"" had always been an ""unnerving presence"" for the group. But now that he is out of the picture and Scary Spice is finally free, Ginger Spice confirms, ""We're not re-forming immediately, but in the near future.""

2431,"Justin Bieber pokes fun at himself after stepping out with an wet mark

Accidents happen, but this star is not sorry about it.

Justin Bieber happily made a joke at his own expense after stepping out with a big wet patch on his pants the day before.

The 23-year-old shared an Instagram of himself and Adam Sandler's character Billy Madison on Thursday to 'fess' up to peeing in his pants.

Just a few hours after pictures of the star surfaced of him with an unfortunate stain on his crotch area, Justin posted a picture of himself next to a screen grab from the movie Billy Madison.

Using a quote from a scene in the 1995 movie, Justin captioned the side-by-side image: 'You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.'

In the popular comedy, Adam's character - an adult man force to return to school to prove he can run his father's business - pretends to pee his pants so that one of his school friends does not get made fun of for actually peeing his pants.

The pee or not pee drama all started after the 24-year-old was seen in West Hollywood, California, with a giant wet patch on the front of his sweats.

The Sorry star's stain covered his entire crotch area and was rather visible in his almost $700 grey Vetements sweatpants.

The star ignored both the wet patch and a cameraman who constantly asked him about his ex Selena Gomez's new relationship with The Weeknd.

Justin made a beeline for his matte black Range Rover which he has had the badge changed on so it says Stealth Rover.

While in too much of a hurry to check his crotch area, Justin was not in too much of a hurry to grab a healthy juice.

Obviously unperturbed by walking around in wet pants, the platinum blond singer then headed to Earthbar.

There he fueled up on a green juice and walked along one of the area's busiest streets without a wet patch care in the world.

Aside from his stained designer sweatpants, Justin wore a white T-shirt with a distressed grey jean jacket and a pair of Nike Air Huarache.

As is his style these days, the Baby hitmaker added a pair of clear lens glasses.

Justin did ditch his stained pants later to head to church late that night.

It was fortunate he opted for jeans, as rumored on and off again love interest Kourtney Kardashian was also there.

There was also no missing Kourt with the 37-year-old wearing a sheer bra-flashing top to the religious service.

Kourtney and the much younger pop star have been linked since 2015 but neither have confirmed if they are romantic or just good friends.

Kathy Griffin got into some hot water after she appeared to be holding Donald Trumpâs severed head in a controversial photo shoot â but she has a plan to win back her audience! An insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the comedian wants to be roasted on Comedy Central so she can put herself in a better spotlight. Will it work?


Kathy Griffin, 56, has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy, but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far. After posing for photographer Tyler Shields, 35, where she held a bloody Donald Trump head, the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash â she even got fired from CNNâs annual NYE special. So is her reputation officially destroyed? Maybe not.



Kathy wants to be the next celebrity roasted on Comedy Central. âKathy knows that she has to combat the recent turmoil she is in with comedy and she wants to face things head on and she wants to be the next person to get roasted,â a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Kathy thinks this could help save her reputation since she is always lightened up when people tease her. âShe wants to show she can take a joke and thinks it will humanize her and make her look better to those she has angered,â our source adds. âShe would love to be the next person that Comedy Central considers.â

Comedy Central has roasted a good amount of celebrities, including Justin Bieber, 23, Rob Lowe, 53, and James Franco, 39. Odds are likely that if Kathy does become the next person to get roasted, then the Trump pic will be one of the biggest moments that comes up. And, perhaps, some other celebs will mock her in a way that makes her look better than she does now. But it might be hard to find someone willing to participate in the roast since a lot of celebrities have expressed their disappointment in her, including Debra Messing, 48, Jeffrey Wright, 51, Don Cheadle, 52, and of course, the president, himself.


Kathy took to her Instagram page on May 30 to post an apology video for the photo. âI sincerely apologize. Iâm just now seeing the reaction of these images. Iâm a comic, I crossed the line and I went way too far,â she said. âThe image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasnât funny, I get it. Iâve made a lot of mistakes in my career I will continue. Iâve asked your forgiveness. Taking down the image, gonna ask the photographer to take down the image and I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far, I made a mistake and I was wrong.â

2432,"Did Angelina Jolie Fake Maddox Jolie Pitt's Adoption? Inside The Shocking Claims

Angelina Jolie is famous for adopting kids from around the world, but did she obtain her first son, Maddox, using falsified documents? Maddox's real Cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that Jolie doesn't have legal power of attorney over the 15-year-old.

According to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Mounh Sarath says that he has official paperwork from Cambodia that confirms he is Maddox's father. Jolie started Maddox's adoption back in 2002, and Brad Pitt legally adopted him in 2006. But according to Sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager.

Sarath and Jolie have not spoken to each other in years. Even more scandalous, the adoption agent Jolie worked with, Lauryn Galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from Cambodia. At the time Jolie adopted Maddox, the United States had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from Cambodia. Did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws?

The Sun reports that Sarath works in charity and local aid in Cambodia. Given his falling out with Jolie and the circumstances surrounding Maddox's adoption, Sarath's opinion of the Tomb Raider star is pretty low.

""I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,"" he added.

Jolie's interest in Cambodia started when she filmed her 2001 hit film in the country, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. She recently directed a movie based in Cambodia, First They Killed My Father, and has visited the country on several different occasions.

The allegations against Angelina Jolie couldn't have come at a worse time. The actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in Cambodia.

Maddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in Jolie's split with Pitt. Shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that Pitt had physically abused Maddox on a private plane. Pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit.

Things between Maddox and Jolie, meanwhile, couldn't be better. Hollywood Life reports that Jolie took Maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to London. During their stay, Jolie and Maddox ventured off to Buckingham Palace for a mother-son date.

The pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. It isn't clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there's a possibility they mingled with Prince William.

The outing came after Jolie gave a speech at the London School of Economics. Jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. The actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the United Nations in London.

Maddox was the only member of the Jolie-Pitt family that accompanied Jolie to the palace. Earlier last week, Jolie was spotted taking Maddox's siblings out to a toy store in London. The kids have since returned to the United States.

As far as Jolie and Pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. Although they haven't finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out.

Given how their divorce played out in the early months, it's definitely good to hear that Jolie and Pitt are working through their differences. They have not released an official comment on Maddox's adoption.

Tell us! Do you think Angelina Jolie could have actually faked the documents to adopt Maddox? Let us know in the comments below.

2601,"Pop insiders claim Justin Bieber cancelled long-running tour as he's considering starting his own church

POP insiders sensationally claim Justin Bieber may have cancelled his current long-running tour so he can start up his own CHURCH. Bieber shocked millions of fans yesterday when he revealed he was calling off the Purpose tour months before it was due to end as he was ""burned out."" The Canadian has revealed he wants to get back to his religious roots

He wrote on Facebook that he was was feeling exhausted after 18 long months on the road. However, sources claim Bieber may now be looking at starting up his own church as part of his plan to get closer to God.

""[Heâs] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether heâs looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own â starting his own church â weâre not quite sure, but thatâs the word from an inside source.â

A statement on the star's Facebook site read: âDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts.

One wrote: "" I'm sad, but i understand. I wish nothing but the best for Justin Bieber and hope all is well. I will be at his next tour and will keep him in prayer.""

While another posted: ""I hope you're okay Justin xxx Your health and wellbeing is more important than the tour.

""We beliebers support you no matter what. None of us care so much about the tour at the moment ...we care about you and your team. Well done for all the hard work you and the rest of the crew did over the past 18 months Love you xxx""

Over the last two years, Bieber has admitted he had turned to God as way of getting his life back on the straight and narrow.

In a media interview, the Canadian said that God had come to him when he was lost.

He believed that ""the almighty"" was telling him something.

That was when he decided to change his life for the better and in his own words, ""get his stuff together.""

And just last month, he took a leap of faith off a cliff in New Zealand, symbolically marking a new chapter in his journey with Christ.

Bieber said the name of ""Jesus"" before launching himself off a cliff at New Zealand's famous Shotover Canyon Swing & Canyon Fox nature reserve.

He fell backwards with closed eyes and hands behind his head.

The video of his fall has reached millions of people. He captioned it #airbaptism and #gracefall.

Bieber was raised in a Christian home but fame and millions of dollars at an early age eroded his relationship with God.

He claims all of that changed when he rededicated his life to Christ and got rebaptised in 2017.

Now he uses his music to express his newfound faith, including singing worship songs at his concerts, and posting pictures of him at church on social media.

BAD BOY From drink-drive arrests to egging houses, Bieber's most outrageous antics Justin Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. The star had been drag racing a yellow Lamborghini on a Miami beach street with R&B singer Khalil, who had been driving a red Ferrari. Charges were later dropped in an agreement which required Bieber to, among other things, go to anger management counselling and make a large donation to the âOur Kidsâ organization. Hours after his lawyer filed a not guilty plea to his drunk-driving charge, Justin Bieber was then charged with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver repeatedly in the back of the head. The alleged assault occurred when the driver collected six people from a Toronto nightclub on 29 December 2013. However criminal charges against Bieber were late withdrawn. Pilots of a private jet taking Justin Bieber and his entourage to the Super Bowl were forced to wear oxygen masks to protect against inhaling marijuana fumes which were filling the plane. NBC news reported that the captain of the plane was so concerned about the abusive behaviour of Bieber and his father towards a flight attendant that he had to move her away from them. Probably the most famous incident, Bieber was sentenced to two yearsâ probation and five days community service for egging the house of his neighbour, sports-agent Jeff Schwartz. As well as community service Bieber was also ordered to pay almost $90,000 in damages to his neighbour and undergo anger management counselling. Bieber stormed off stage mid-performance in Manchester after demanding that the crowd stop screaming in between his songs. However the singer did later return to finish his set. The pop star is filmed apparently punching a fan in Barcelona. The fan leaned into Bieberâs moving vehicle to touch him and footage shows Bieber seemingly responding by punching the fan in the face

2467,"Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the ""Real"" Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike

Beverly Hills| The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence, when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true.

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the ""real"" Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9 1966, after an argument during a Beatles' recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who wasÂ the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.

""When Paul died, weÂ allÂ panicked!"" claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. ""We didn't know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by andÂ nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn't get along with John, at all.""

William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed ""disappear "" from recordsÂ in 1966 and noÂ traces of him can be found after Paul's alleged death.

Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.

He notably says that the entire Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officiallyÂ formed a ""new"" band featuring a ""fictional"" member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul's replacement.

""We felt guilty about the deception"" added Ringo Starr. ""We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.""

Ringo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth, because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only otherÂ surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.

The rumors of Paul's death began more than 45 years ago, but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage. In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Clue-hunting rapidlyÂ proved infectious, and within a few weeks, itÂ had become an international phenomenon. Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969.

Neither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage have commented Ringo Starr's declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world. Journalists and paparazzis from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are awaiting for the star to comment the allegations.

The British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years asÂ theÂ Member of the Order of the British Empire,Â Sir JamesÂ Paul McCartney,Â during official ceremonies involvingÂ Queen Elizabeth II.

Costar conflicts! While celebs remain professional when the cameras are rolling, behind the scenes there are catfights, crying and eye-rolling. Whether they were forced to work together for several seasons of a hit TV show or a few months for a film, these stars just couldn't seem to get along.

Rumored rift! While Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall played besties Carrie Bradshaw and Samantha Jones on Sex and the City from 1998 to 2004, there was always talk that they were feuding. The ladies reportedly had a big falling out in the show's final season when Parker was paid considerably more than Cattrall on the HBO series.

2414,"Jennifer Aniston on the Exact Moment She Had It With the Pregnancy Rumors

In July, Jennifer Aniston powerfully spoke out against the constant tabloid pregnancy rumors about her that have circulated through the years, in an op-ed for Huffington Post. ""For the record, I am not pregnant,"" she wrote in it. ""What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'""

""If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.""

The post went viral-but initially, Aniston wasn't even planning on publishing it. She told Ellen DeGeneres this week that she wrote it at first just for herself. ""You know how we kind of write and don't necessarily send it? Or at least when I was a kid I did that. And yeah, I kind of hit a wall. I was pretty raw at the time, just came back from a vacation. My mother sort of-had sort of?-she passed [away],"" Aniston said.

She and husband Justin Theroux had gone away to the Bahamas in the middle of ""nowhere"". But ""we were mobbed, like a scary kind of mob. Like, I didn't know what was happening. I kept thinking, 'Is Kim Kardashian behind me or something? This is very strange.' And then it turns out that another wonderful photograph, which I've had to sort of live with for the last 10 to 15 years: a picture of me with a bump and a circle around my stomach with an arrow pointing to it. Just in this sort of kind of objectifying way, and I was just fed up with it.""

She then poignantly echoed the point she made in her piece: that women are defined by more than just being mothers:

I think these tabloids, all of us, need to take responsibility on what we ingest into our brains. Just because we are women, we have a uterus, we have a vagina, we have ovaries, we need to like, ""Get to work, lady!"" As opposed to, hello, Freedom Medal. We as women do a lot of incredible things in this world other than just procreate-and not that that is not-but it's like we just get boxed in. They love the narrative, they love the story, they love the ""She's jealous of this person, and she's depressed, and oh my god she's never going to have a..."" Whatever the horrible little headline is, we've just got to break out of that and go whoa, whoa. And women, I have to say, are many of the authors of these horrible articles that are written in these B.S. tabloids. So, we have to stop listening to them, we have to stop buying them because we have to support each other, especially at this time, to love each other, to support, and to be proud of women, of whatever your choice is in life. It's up to us what makes us happy and fulfilled.

Run ROSIE RUN â right back onto ""The View""! WHY?!

""THE Real Housewives of Miami"" may be fun to watch on TV, but one of the couples on the Bravo reality show drove Rosie O'Donnell right out of her ritzy neighborhood!

The outspoken comedian couldn't stand living near Lisa Hochstein and her plastic surgeon husband Dr. Lenny ""Boob God"" Hochstein on exclusive Star Island, so she sold her home of 18 years for a whopping $16.5 million.

""It was getting a little CRAZY with all those tour boats and that Miami Show...The Beverly...The Mom of Miami, whatever it is, Housewives,"" Rosie told a radio interviewer.

An insider added: ""Rosie thinks the Hochsteins are crass and totally classless, and all the nosy fans and camera crews that come with being a 'Housewife' were driving her nuts.

""She loved Star Island and many of her neighbors. She really thought she would grow old there. But because of Lisa and her husband, she decided to sell her home.""

Things hit rock bottom for Rosie last October with the heavy media coverage of the Hochsteins' Halloween party â which featured a black Jesus bound to a crucifix, a bloody zombie giving ""birth"" to a stillborn baby, and other creepy and bloody displays.

About that time, mother-of-five Rosie was contacted by a real estate agent who asked if she was interested in putting her mansion up for sale, and the enÂ­tertainer gave a resounding yes.

The former talk-show host, who married executive-search consultant Michelle Rounds in 2012 and adopted a baby girl with her, reportedly bought a $5 million home in the far sleepier Sarasota, Fla., area.

""Rosie thought about organizing the community to pressure the neighbors from hell to move,"" said the source. ""But with a new wife and baby, she decided to take the high road and simply find a new home.""

2583,"Kim and Kanye's marriage on the rocks as she's pictured WITHOUT wedding ring

FRIENDS say Kim Kardashian and Kanye Westâs marriage is over.

US reality star Kim, 36, ditched her wedding ring as her relationship with the rapper hit rock bottom.

Kim ordered husband Kanye to stay away from her familyâs traditional Christmas Eve bash, friends revealed last night.

Her wedding finger was bare on Saturday night as she partied with her mum and sisters at their annual festive gathering in LA.

Troubled rapper Kanye, 39, instead went to the cinema with friends.

But he then defied Kimâs warning by making a late appearance at the event.

However, she is said to have blanked her husband and insiders last night claimed their two-year marriage is âas good as overâ.



 Kendall Jenner says family are praying for Kanye West's recovery

It comes at the end of a nightmare 2016 for the couple which saw Kim, 36, robbed at gunpoint in Paris in October and Kanye hospitalised a month later after a mental breakdown.

The pair put on a united front with their daughter North, three, at a Â­performance of The Nutcracker ballet at an LA theatre on Friday.

However, onlookers revealed the Â­couple â who also have a year-old son Saint â barely spoke to each other.

A source said: âKim and Kanyeâs marriage is as good as over. Itâs looking bleak.

""She didnât want Kanye at her mumâs Christmas bash this year, as she felt it was the first time she could really let her hair down.

âBut he made a late show and spent the last hour just sitting on the couch talking to Scott Disick [dad of Kourtneyâs kids] â he was a total wallflower.

âOn Friday they took North to see The Nutcracker but they barely spoke or interacted inside.

""The tensions were Â visible. Neither of them are in a happy place right now.

âHe spent Christmas morning at Krisâ [Kimâs mum] to make things as normal for the kids as possible, but itâs just a matter of timing.

""The only thing that might keep them together is the kids.â



 New video of Kanye West ranting before he stops Sacramento gig early

Kim, who wore a gold dress at the Christmas Eve party in Calabasas, blew kisses in a video shared on her sister Khloeâs Snapchat account.

She was also sporting a new lip ring but her wedding band was off.

In the video, Khloe, 32, can be heard saying: âHow dope is my f***ing sister? Look at this dress. And look at the jewellery. You are a bad*** bitch, Kim.â

The US reality star has barely been seen in public since her Paris ordeal, when she was bound and robbed at gunpoint in a reported Â£8.5million heist.

Kanye has cancelled all tour dates after coming out of hospital at the end of November.

He suffered a mental breakdown, with a cousin claiming he has âstopped trusting peopleâ.

Lawrence Franklin claimed last week Kanyeâs decline started after he paid Â£200,000 to a relative who was threatening to leak a sex tape of him.

Kim and Kanye have Â also reportedly been Â in counselling while the rapper is Â receiving therapy.

Kim is said to be still angry after Kanye flew to New York for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump within hours of leaving hospital.

A source said: âIt was the worst thing that he has ever done in her eyes. When she tried to get him to call it off and come home, he refused.â

Any break-up is likely to lead to a complicated split of Kanyeâs fortune, estimated by Forbes to be Â£145million.

White Witch warns Angelina against using spells to woo back Brad


A white witch from North London has urgedÂ Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back ex-husband Brad Pitt.

Back in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.

'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,' Carrie told FEMAIL. 'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.

'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'

Carrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,

It was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.

Carrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.

'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.

'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'

'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.

Carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone elseâs will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, wonât work.Â  'When a person works magic to ""keep"" or ""get"" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said.Â  Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly.Â  Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy.Â  May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heartâs desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know?Â  Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover.Â  When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.'Â Then let the candle burn all the way down.

'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.

'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.

'It's like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.

'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.

Angelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.

She acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had theÂ left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.

The process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.

Carrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.

'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.

'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the ""magic"" of another culture.'

The star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat,Â purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.

'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.

'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.

It's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.

'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.

'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'

Assisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.

'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'

When working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are â or have been â witches.

'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.

'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do.

2595,"Tom Hiddleston Still Embarrassed About Taylor Swift: Ignores Fans and Media at Comic-Con | Celeb Dirty Laundry

For the past several years, actor Tom Hiddleston has been a fan favorite at the San Diego Comic-Con. But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, âThor: Ragnarokâ were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddlestonâs portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, âThorâ has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.

Although Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.

This is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting âThor: The Dark Worldâ, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.

Audience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didnât appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tomâs own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasnât just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.

Many believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tomâs decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.

Of course, Tom and Taylor Swiftâs romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reportedÂ that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.

2535,"Kim Kardashian Hires Team To Help Her Become More âPoliticalâ â âI Want To Speak Out More About Political Issuesâ

The controversial reality TV star really wants to change her reputation. We have learned that Kim Kardashian wants to have a much more political image and sheâs already making the first few steps in that direction.

According to a source close to the famous family, Kim would like to hire herself a political publicist and Kanye West has been looking for one.

In a recent interview with Harperâs Bazaar Arabia, Kim revealed that sheâd love to become a more politically active celeb but is scared of making any mistakes and offending people.

âSometimes I feel like I want to speak out more about political issues. You have to be really careful about what you say, because a lot of things can be taken in the wrong context and I always want to be respectful; I do not want to hurt anyoneâs feelings. I said once before that I am not really a feminist. But I feel like I do a lot more than people that claim that they are feminist. To clarify what I said before: I feel in my soul I am a feminist. I just don not need labels to make me feel or know what I am inside,â the Kardashian explained.

She went on to say that for her, feminists are all of the girls around us and on social media that stand up for themselves and for certain issues.

For the KUWK star, those women are the most empowering.

Do you think itâs a good idea for Kim to become more vocal about her political views?

2449,"Justin Bieber Vacation: Purpose Tour On Hold After Awards Show Rant? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

It appears that Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour is on hold and Justin is on vacation with friends. Justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow.Â The vacation photos started popping up on Justin's Instagram on May 25. Looks as if Justin went camping with an assortment of friends. The singer, who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts, wrote, ""These are the nights I live for.""

While taking some time off Justin is jet-skiing, maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out. Justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos. On May 27 Justin posted a selfie on Instagram â he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background.

But what's going on with the Purpose Tour? Checking out Justin's website all previous concert dates have been removed. You can't tell for certain if Justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because he's burned out.

The first signs that Justin Bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a CD doesn't mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like he's your bestie. You buy a CD and that's all you're entitled to, a CD, not a piece of Justin.

Next Justin kind of snapped after the Billboard Music Awards saying all these awards shows are all fake, shallow and meaningless. Yet a few days later Justin profusely thanked the Teen Choice Awards for the three nominations he received. Once again, Justin used Instagram to express himself.

The Purpose Tour resumes on June 11 with several stops in Canada and then through the United States through July 19. After two Tokyo shows in August the tour resumes in Europe in September and runs non-stop through the end of November.

A schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks. Hopefully Justin will get some much needed R&R and put all the controversy behind him when the tour resumes.

2611,"Cher: Ready To Die!

The beat no longer goes on for CHER.

The freaked-out diva has become obsessed with her late ex-husband, Sonny Bono, and believes sheâll join him soon, shocked pals told The National ENQUIRER in a bombshell world exclusive.

âCher truly believes the end is near for her,â said a family pal. âIâve never seen anything like it! Sheâs scaring the hell out of everyone.â

According to the source, the 69-year-old showbiz legend spends most of her time revisiting her past with Sonny, her longtime performing partner who died on Jan. 5, 1998, at the age of 62.

âItâs all about Sonny nowadays,â said the source.

Most disturbing of all, âsheâs been paying secret visits to Sonnyâs grave and giving away many of her possessions,â added the source.

Sonny and Cher were married from 1964 to 1975, and charted six Top 10 hits, including the classics, âI Got You Babeâ and âThe Beat Goes On.â

He was killed in a horrible skiing accident in Nevada and is buried near Palm Springs, Calif., where he served as mayor and later was elected to Congress.

âCher goes to his gravesite with flowers and comes back all weepy and looking like death warmed over,â said the source. âSheâs even cried, âIâm ready to be with Sonny again.âââ

As The ENQUIRER reported in April, the Oscar-winning âMoonstruckâ star â who is worth a reported $320 million â is suffering from both physical ailments, and the stress of a turbulent personal life.

At the time, she was also dealing with her disastrous D2K concert tour, which was plagued by infighting, lawsuits and medical woes that left a âdevastatedâ Cher canceling 23 shows.

Dealing with her children has also taken a debilitating toll on the âMaskâ star, insiders said. Last year Cher forced her estranged son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his new bride to leave her Malibu home, which she believes is haunted by Sonny.

Sheâs also deeply concerned that her transgendered and outspoken son, Chaz, could be a target by appearing at gay pride rallies.

Meanwhile, the âBelieveâ singerâs longtime battle with the EpsteinâBarr virus has wreaked havoc on her heart and kidneys.

At the time of her first bout with the viral infection â during which she vanished for five months in the early 1990s â Cher told a friend: âThis disease makes me feel bone-weary, deeply depressed â and as though all my muscles have turned to Jell-O!â

As The ENQUIRER reported at the time, her publicist told us that doctors had outfitted her with a heart monitor after continuing kidney woes.

When contacted about the specific allegations in this story, her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg told The ENQUIRER that Cher had fully recovered and any claims that sheâs headed for an early grave were false and inaccurate.

But recent photographs of a somber Cher on a visit to St. Tropez were telling: She had to be supported by friends who firmly grasped her arms, believing she was close to collapse. âCherâs been there before and always loved it. But she regrets never having visited with Sonny,â said the source.

âThey planned on going a number of times, but something always happened.

âNow, Cher wanted to go with Sonny on her mind. Sheâs calling it the visit she and Sonny âalways wanted but never had.â Itâs heartbreaking.â

Despite the trip, the frustrated entertainer has confined herself to her Malibu mansion.

âCher has a golf cart that she loves,â said one local. âShe used to be seen driving [it] around Malibu with a hat and glasses. She would wave to people and chat, but those little rides seem to be a thing of the past.â

Other Malibu sources told The ENQUIRER that Cher seems âvery isolated,â while former members of her inner circle are saddened to see her spending her days in bed using a laptop to rant on social media about politics.

âHer management even went to Cher to say sheâs got to tone it down, because sheâs coming across as angry,â another source said. âBut she told them to fâk off.â

Added the friend: âItâs like Cher knows itâs all over, and sheâs ready to go. Sheâs hoping Sonny will be there waiting for her in Heaven.â

2530,"Kim Kardashian talks her surrogate

She's expecting her third child via surrogate.

But the woman carrying Kim Kardashian's unborn child didn't even know she was carrying the super star's baby.

'She didn't know at the beginning,' Kim, 37, revealed during her appearance on the talk show The Real on Thursday.

Asked if it was even safe to tell the surrogate herÂ identity, Kim said it was possible to go through the process anonymously.

But she said had fears the surrogate may not even be a fan of hers.

'Well you can do it totally anonymously,' Kim replied.Â  'You could go that route, and I just felt like I wanted, whoever's carrying my baby, like what if they weren't a fan of me or my husband? And what if they didn't want to be carrying our baby?'

Kim said she wanted to develop a relationship with the woman.

'I wanted to give them that choice and be proud and on the same page and I wanted a relationship with her.'

Luckily Kim's surrogate was delighted to learn whose child she was carrying, and was 'proud' to do so, knowing the complications she suffered from during her previous pregnancies.

'She was really excited! She was someone that had watched the show, not like a super fan or anything that it would have been uncomfortable, but she had seen my struggle and seen how open I was about it. So she was really proud to do it, really excited,' Kim said.

Kim recently threw herself a baby shower, though explained she didn't invite the surrogate.

'I, um, I did not [invite her]. I did introduce her to my family. I introduced her to my family earlier that day. And, you know, I just thought, I donât know, it was like a weird decision to have to make,' said the KUWTK star.

'I think I have to explain it to my kids first and figure out how Iâm going to explain it to them.'

Kim insisted there are no ill feelings.

'I love her. I have the best relationship with my surrogate. Sheâs so nice. She is the perfect person to do this for my family. Sheâs great. Sheâs been amazing.'

Kim and her husband Kanye West also haveÂ daughter North, four, and son Saint, one.

Caitlyn Jenner recently released her memoir The Secrets of My Life which she has said is about her âjourneyâ but has also been a scathing attack on her ex, Kris.

The 67-year-old has made some outrageous claims in her memoir about Kris knowing all along about her wanting to transition to a woman and even accused the momager of keeping money from her.

Caitlyn also recently revealed to The Sunday Times she was ânever comfortableâ having sex with Kris during their 23-year marriage. Ouch!

2457,"Kanye West: If He's Not North's Father, Which Of Kim Kardashian's Exes Is?

OMG! We can't imagine Kanye West, 38, not being the bio dad for precious daughter North, two, but according to a new report, he's not real her father, so who is? Kim Kardashian, 35, has had several famous exes she could have turned to when she wanted to have a child, and since she froze her eggs,Â she may have asked one of them to become a baby daddy.Â Let's take a look at who the candidates could be!

According to a cover story in Star magazine, Kim froze her eggs in 2012 when she was worried about her ticking biological clock, and had an ex fertilize one before she got with Kanye. ""There'd been buzz that Kim had frozen some embryos, which she'd created with an ex-boyfriend's sperm, so she could have a baby when she was ready.""

So who could the daddy be? We know Kim always deeply loved Reggie Bush, 31, as they dated on and off for three years, from 2007 â 2010. And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North's daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.

Her most recent ex would have been Kris Humphries, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011. While their union ended on bitter terms, could she have still turned to him to help father a baby? After all, they still weren't divorced when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner Ray J, 35? Could Kim have asked him for a daddy favor?

Star's report claimsÂ that Kanye wasn't as eager about having kids as Kim was.Â ""When Kanye refused to back down, Kim may have had one of the embryos implanted,"" their source said. ""She didn't have time to wait for Kanye,"" the magazine claims.

""People are speculating that Kim tricked Kanye into believing they conceived in Italy so he wouldn't figure out the real story, that she'd already been implanted with an embryo that had another man's DNA!"" according to their story.

While neither Kim or Kanye has commented yet, this story is pretty unbelievable. North looks like an absolutely perfect genetic combination of Kim and Kanye that simply cannot be denied!

Posh is set to release the book next year to mark 10 years in the fashion business. The Spice Girl-turned-designer is said to have teamed up with US Vogue editor Anna Wintour. The pair have become close friends in recent years, with Wintour said to be the driving force behind the guide.

Posh has already released one bestselling fashion advice guide. But that was in 2006, before she became a world-famous designer.

2485,"Ellen, Portia cancel appearance after 'epic' fight

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi didn't show up at a charity fund-raiser for rescued animals after having a huge fight in the car on the way to Sunday's event, sources tell Page Six.

The power couple was on the way to the Saving SPOT! fund-raiser at Tiato in Santa Monica when they got into an argument and turned around without attending the event, even though they were listed and pictured on the invitation as hosts. Ellen and Portia on Monday insisted to Page Six they had informed the charity they would be unable to make it and their picture should not have been on the invitation.

A source told us: ""Ellen and Portia were supposed to be at the event at 5 p.m., but at 6:30 p.m., the media was still waiting for their arrival. Reporters were told they were on their way, until the head of the charity informed everyone at the end of the event that they weren't going to make it due to 'logistics.'""

The source added, ""Ellen and Portia were delayed and were in the car on the way, when they had an epic fight. They ended up turning around and not going to the fund-raiser.""

Saving SPOT! is a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing dogs and providing them with caring owners. Ellen and Portia attended last year's benefit in Beverly Hills and had been happy to be listed as hosts for this year's event, we're told.

Ellen - a generous animal-welfare supporter - and Portia said in a statement to Page Six: ""We were happy to lend our names as honorary chairs and the organization was always aware that we would be unable to attend. This is the first time we have seen our images attached to the invite. It was not approved and it is misleading.""

DeGeneres' attorney Marty Singer said, ""The story is a complete lie. My client told the organizer they never agreed nor planned to attend the event. There was no fight that caused them not to attend."" The charity didn't respond to requests for comment.

Ellen recently slammed divorce rumors and reports of arguments on the season premiere of her talk show. ""I had a great summer,"" she said in September. ""I went on a trip with Portia, my beautiful wife - who I am happily married to, but thank you for your heartfelt concern, tabloids.""

2643,"Prince William and Kate Middleton Moving Out Of Kensington Palace? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Prince William and Kate Middleton are already thinking about moving out of Kensington Palace. Thatâs because William doesnât want his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to grow up behind palace walls. Instead, he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible.

In his interview with British GQ, Prince William said that the most important thing for him is knowing that Prince George and Princess Charlotte will grow up in a happy, stable secure world.

In other words, he doesnât want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors. And while Prince William and Kate Middleton havenât fully moved in to Kensington Palace just yet, they are already thinking about their next move. Apparently, London is the last place that William wants to be with Kate and their kids.

Of course, if Prince William and Kate Middleton do end up moving from Kensington Palace, royal observers wouldnât be surprised. Itâs taken them this long to move back to London after having spent the last several years at Anmer Hall. Prince William has made it no secret that he doesnât want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up.

Ideally, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would love to move back to Anmer Hall. It was a gift given to them by Queen Elizabeth. The property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to run around in all day and night.

But of course for Prince William this wonât be easy. He can try and live a private life as much as he wants to, but at the same time he is the future King of England. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be in the spotlight whether he likes it or not. And as much as he would love to return to Anmer Hall in the future, it might not happen.

All of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in London. Thatâs why many royal fans believe that sooner or later William will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do.

2478,"Did Charlize Theron Break Keanu Reeves' Heart By Dating Sean Penn?

Charlize Theron may have broken Keanu Reeves' tender heart by hooking up with fellow thespian Sean Penn.

The Monster star and the Gangster Squad alum were reportedly spotted together on a beach not too long ago, fueling rumors that the pair were starting to get romantic. Adding fuel to the flames of speculations were photos of Theron snuggling up to Penn at a pre-Oscar party over the weekend.

Check out Charlize Theron and Sean Penn hanging out at Pharrell Williams' shindig below. Chances are their appearance at the gathering will only cause rumors of their rumored romance to spiral completely out of control.

Since Charlize Theron has reportedly found a boyfriend, a close ""friend"" told the folks over at OK! magazine that Keanu Reeves isn't exactly thrilled with the situation. Since he and Theron had an on-again off-again relationship for years, the 47 Ronin star is apparently a little depressed.

""To see her falling in love with Sean is really hurting him. Charlize and Keanu have been secretly on-and-off for so long. I think he thought they would eventually end up together for good. He's a little heartbroken,"" the insider dished to the publication.

Of course, Charlize Theron's new romance doesn't come without its own set of unique problems. According to Star, yet another anonymous source believes that the actress's mom is very worried that Penn could up and leave at any moment. It goes without saying that no one should take this information as gospel.

""The South African native if fearful that womanizing Sean will break her daughter's heart. While the protective mama bear has never minded their friendship, sources say she 'begged Charlize not to let it turn romantic,'"" the insider said.

If you're more concerned with Theron's career than her private life, then you definitely have a few projects headed to your neighborhood multiplex in the next few years. Not only does she appear in Ted director Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West, Charlize also plays a significant role in the highly-anticipated sci-fi flick Mad Max: Fury Road.

2533,"Kim Kardashian displays shocking hair loss after 'relying on weaves'

She's left fans green with envy thanks to her incredible post-pregnancy weight loss. 



But it seems that Kim Kardashian's rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair. 



Images of the 33-year-old with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss, which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions.

And according to hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina, it could be Kim's rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss. 



Tatiana told MailOnline: 'It is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones, making it thicker and lusher, but when you have the baby most women find theyÂ  seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal.

'What with the rapid amount of weight Kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth, this may have accelerated the hair loss, giving sparser looking patches, we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline.

 Where the real ends and the fake begins: The line of Kim's extensions could clearly be seen During pregnancy: Kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last May 'Birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume.' Tatiana added that Kim's apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with Traction Alopecia, and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesn't want to damage her hair further. 

 She told MailOnline: 'In spite of giving instant full thick hair, weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp, often too heavy and tight, the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and Traction Alopecia, and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth.

'I would not recommend that Kim keep the weave in her hair, but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions, or a simple clip-in that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp.'

Kim isn't the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves.

Rihanna and Naomi Campbell are among the other famous faces to have found themselves with damaged hair after boosting their barnets with extensions.

Fifty Shades Darker may now be in trouble with reported feuding between cast members Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.

Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are'nt in good terms and the movie's sequel, Fifty Shades Freed is facing cancellation threats. Â According to Chattsports,Â  Dornan is busy with a new movie.

Excited fans are disappointed that the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey might be postponed to a later date. According to the reporte, Dornan was furious with Johnson's actions on set. However, there is no reported information on what the actual reason was. The article reportedly stated that the feud started during the filming of the movie.

It is claimed that the sequel's release date could actually be in trouble since there is a lot of tension between the actors.Â As reported byÂ Australian Network News, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson reportedly have a great chemistry on screen and hence, they were rumoured to have an affair. But both of them have never confirmed the status of their real life relationship.

The main reason for their reported split is because of Jamie Dornan's new movie, Untogether. Now because of this tension, even reports now say that the release date of Fifty Shades Darker has been affected.

Meanwhile, Untogether will reportedly feature the life of a drug addict, and Dornan will play the role of a writer. The production team reportedly did not confirm anything yet and the rumours were debunked because of lack of factual details.

2634,"Robert Pattinson Finally Has Successful Movie - Twilight Curse Over? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Robert Pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film, âGood Timeâ. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. There is also Oscar buzz surrounding Robert, with some speculating he could receive a Best Actor nomination.

In the gritty, crime film, Robert portrays a criminal named Connie Nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. Robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. The star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in New York without anyone knowing who he was.

When the film premiered recently at Cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting âBravoâ and many came up to Robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. Critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for Robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office.

Of course everyone knows Robertâs big break came with the 2008 film, âTwilightâ where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, Edward Cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. The âTwilightâ movies became a billion dollar franchise, making Robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. While he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in Hollywood and almost ruined his career.

For the past few year, Robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, âRemember Meâ and mostly forgettable indie films. Some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the âTwilight Curseâ.

Since the ending of the âTwilightâ and itâs sequels in 2012, most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. Taylor Lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, âAbductionâ, he disappeared from Hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with âScream Queensâ.

Other actors from the movie franchise, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson Rathbone have also had trouble finding success after âTwilightâ with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-DVD movie.

Kristen Stewart, who portrayed Bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married âSnow White and the Huntsmanâ director.

With the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, Iâm sure Robert Pattinson is glad his âTwilight Curseâ appears to be over.

2415,"Angelina Jolie Threatens Brad Pitt: Don't Bring The Kids Around Jennifer Aniston

Although Angelina Jolie, 41, andÂ Brad Pitt, 53, opted to make their legal docs involving their split completely private on Jan. 10, 2017, Angie's reportedly got a new demand to add to their split negotiations. She doesn't want Brad's reported new texting buddy,Â Jennifer Aniston, 48, anywhere near her kids, according to In Touch.

""As Angie and Brad's divorce talks continue, she's demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen,"" the mag reported. Brad and Angie share six children together -Â Maddox, 15,Â Pax, 12,Â Zahara, 11,Â Shiloh, 10, and twinsÂ KnoxÂ andÂ Vivienne, 8.

The actor has reportedly been leaning on his ex-wife while he deals with his emotional split from Angie. He and Jen married in July 2000 and ended their courtship in Oct. 2005 after he met Angie on the set of their love, action flick, Mr & Mrs. Smith. However, he's reportedly reconciled with Jen viaÂ phone. The two have allegedly been exchanging sweetÂ messages over various phone calls and text messages, according to the mag. To make matters worse, Angie apparently knowsÂ about Brad and Jen'sÂ alleged newfound relationship and she's not happy whatsoever.

As for Brad's take on Angie's reported request that he should keep Jen far away from their six children? - ""Brad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,"" the mag reported. In fact, ""He isn't going to cave in to Angie's ridiculous demand... Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences."" Harsh...

While Brad, Angie or Jennifer have not commented on this wild report, here's what HollywoodLife.com knows:Â ""Angelina was never able to get over her obsession with BradÂ and Jennifer's relationship,"" a source EXCLUSIVELY told us. As a matter of fact, Angie always feared that Brad would go back with Jen. Wow.

Things haven't been going too well for Brad throughout his nasty split with Angie. When she filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2016, she also requested sole physical custody of their six children. Brad and Angie reached a private, temporary custody agreementÂ on Sept. 30, which granted her full physical custody, andÂ him with visitation approved by a therapist.

After multiple disputes between the couple in scathing court docs, they decided to release a joint statement on Jan. 10, 2017, which revealed that they agreed to keep their court docs private. Since then, the exes have remained tight-lipped on the status of their broken marriage.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Brad and Jennifer are really texting?

2540,"The Weeknd Was Spotted Holding Hands With Justin Bieberâs Ex

If youâre an avid US Weekly reader, it might appear that there are only about a dozen single people in Hollywood, as they all date each other. Itâs like six degrees of separation with Kevin Bacon, only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers, whereÂ Scott Disick is the connecting factor.

Here, we prove that theory. After Selena Gomez and the Weeknd dated for about a year, they broke up and she was spotted back with her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber, almost immediately. Now, it looks like the Weeknd wants revenge, and is using his party monster ways to get it.Â While Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been attending church twice in one dayâapparently, the new couple has a lot to repent forâthe Weeknd has been parading models around.

The Weeknd was caught canoodling with Bieberâs rumored ex, model Yovanna Ventura. He was even spotted holding hands with the model, which is almost as serious as becoming Instagram official.Â According to an Us Weekly sourceÂ who saw The Weeknd in action, âHe was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.â

The potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in Beverly Hills for French Montana (who dated Khloe Kardashian, whose sister Kourtney Kardashian was rumored to have dated Bieberâand to make everything more confusing, The Weeknd previously dated Bella Hadid, a close friend of the Kardashian/Jenner family). Itâs all very Degrassi, only Drake is slightly less involvedâalthough heâs rumored to be hooking up with Hadid and feuding with The Weeknd because of it.

The Weeknd and Ventura were also seen leaving Hyde nightclub togetherÂ in the back of an SUV, much like Leonardo DiCaprio and his model friend, 19-year-old Juliette Perkins.Â And thereâs another Leo linkâThe Weeknd made sure to stop byÂ Leonardo DiCaprioâs 43rd birthdayÂ with model Emily Ratajkowski.

Leoâs birthday was held at the Highlight Room, a rooftop club that opened above the Dream Hollywood hotel in Los Angeles and currently has two stars on Yelp. Of course, there were plenty of models milling about, leaving ample options for The Weekndâbut not all of them had been linked to Bieber in the past.

It looks like Bieber, Gomez and The Weeknd should all start writing for their next break-up albumsâ¦or maybe they can all just collaborate on one.

Pop songbird Gwen Stefani could end up deaf and wreck her fabulous singing career

by performing too soon after rupturing her eardrum, say experts.

Docs ordered the Voice coach not to sing or travel by plane after her career-threatening health crisis.

But The Sweet Escape singer insisted on belting out a tune on The Voice just a week later.

Her beau and fellow coach, Blake Shelton, praised his platinum blond gal pal as âtough,â

âLoud music or singing could cause further damage and lead to partial or permanent deafness,â

says New York internist Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated the singer.

The mom of threeâs nightmare turned terrifyingly real on an April 25 flight from L.A. to Las Vegas, where she was to sing

at the Keep Memory Aliveâs Power of Love gala. âShe had a head cold, and the pressure in the cabin blew her eardrum out,â says a source.

With only a few weeks until The View premieres with Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that on the set, the two divas are already at a stand-off over who will get the moderator seat.

Goldberg has sat in the prized moderator seat since taking over from O'Donnell, and now ""Rosie wants it back from Whoopi,"" an insider told Radar. ""It doesn't matter to Rosie that Whoopi has sat there for the last several years. Rosie doesn't want to be sitting anywhere but back in her old spot.""

""In Rosie's mind, this is once again her show,"" the source continued. ""Whoopi won't be giving it up, and Rosie even suggested they trade seats every other week. It's all a power trip for Rosie, which is resulting in tension on the staff.""

And even though Goldberg just signed a four-year contract as a co-host on the hit ABC show,Â  a source tells The National ENQUIRER that she already wants out!

""Whoopi regrets roping herself in like that and is trying to figure a way out,"" said a source close to Goldberg. ""She wants to do other projects and feels network honchos are holding her back.""

After co-hosts Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd were forced out, and it was announced recently that controversial host O'Donnell will return, Goldberg doesn't trust anyone that's left on the hit show.

2526,"Blake Griffin: Did He Kick His Baby Mama Out For Kendall Jenner?

It's only been a few weeks since the world learned that Blake Griffin and Kendall Jenner are dating, but it looks as though the lanky couple is moving very fast.

They've been hanging out in public; she's already banned from the Staples Center ...

Yes, they've checking off items from the ""new Kardashian-professional athlete relationship"" checklist at breakneck speed.

There's just one problem.

Neither Blake nor Kendall was 100 percent single when they met, which means they're both in the process of distancing themselves from their most recent exes as they simultaneously attempt to build a new relationship together.

Insiders say Kendall was still dating A$AP Rocky when she started hooking up with Blake, but it sounds like that situation won't present much of a challenge.

âHe isnât the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend, so sheâs playing the field too,"" one insider said of Rocky.

So we imagine he wasn't too torn up about being cut from Team Kendall.

Blake, on the other hand, is in a bit of a tighter spot.

The LA Clippers forward has two kids with Brynn Cameron, whom he dated for several years.

Though the couple had experienced relationship troubles in recent months and even lived apart during a trial separation, sources say Cameron was blindsided by the news that Griffin was dating Kendall.

According to sources close to the couple, Cameron unexpectedly moved out of the home she previously shared with Griffin this week.

And naturally, many are claiming that Kendall is to blame.

""Both Brynn and Blake have been staying at rented places since their breakup happened. It seemed like they wanted to give it time for the dust to settle before disrupting the kids with a big move,"" one insider reveals.

""That said, Brynn feels totally betrayed and mortified that Blake has chosen to be so public with Kendall, and she just wants this whole mess to be over,"" the informant adds.

""Heâs in Clippers training camp now, so she figured it was the perfect time to do it.""

So it sounds like Blake and Brynn were headed in the vague direction of Splitsville, but Kendall was what drove them to finally call it quits.

Fans are reportedly angry, as Brynn was a beloved member of the Clippers community.

Wait until the NBA season starts and all the ""Kardashian curse"" talk comes with it.

2607,"Kate Middleton Desperate To Save Prince William Marriage: Can't Let Go Of Pampered Royal Lifestyle | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Kate Middleton might be angry with her husband Prince William for embarrassing their family with his bizarre dancing and drinking during his ski trip, and all of the cheating rumors, but that doesnât mean sheâll be divorcing him anytime soon. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tried to convince everyone that they are still madly in love during their trip to Paris this weekend.

Prince William and Kate Middleton rekindled their shared love of art during a visit to the Musee DâOrsay in Paris. The Duke and Duchess first fell in love while studying art history at St Andrewâs University in Scotland nearly two decades ago.

Eyewitnesses say that art enthusiast Kate Middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with William by her side. Kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour. Insiders say that Prince William, meanwhile, looked tired and tense.

Judging from the photos that were snapped, there is some major tension between the Royal couple right now. Â Kate looked absolutely miserable!

Thereâs a possibility that Kate Middleton is worried that if she does divorce Prince William, she wonât have the same privileged lifestyle that she has now. Itâs no secret that the Duchess of Cambridge makes headlines simply because sheâs Prince Williamâs wife. But, if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage, Kateâs life wonât be the same.

She wonât be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances. And, thatâs probably what sheâll miss the most. Kate Middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family, she wonât be in it anymore.

Plus, royal observers know that if Kate Middleton forgives Prince William for his antics drunken antics now, thereâs a good chance that sheâll forgive him again and again. In other words, the Duchess is turning a blind eye to her husbandâs behavior because she probably doesnât have any other choice. Itâs either this or she goes back to her mother Carole Middletonâs party favor business. Do you agree?

We still can't get over the fact that the No. 1 diva herself Mariah Carey has agreed to be a judge on ' American Idol .' Of course, with a price tag of $18 million, we're not terribly surprised, but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like ' X Factor ' judge Britney Spears and ' The Voice ' judge Christina Aguilera .

Carey has carried the label ""diva"" with her for years, so the 'Idol' staff is doing the only thing they can at the moment: preparing. Her backstage rider has previously consisted of outrageous demands, so it's no wonder staffers are bracing themselves for Carey's arrival. Let's take a look at some of her previous requests:

Done scratching your head yet? Okay. But the following may be most shocking of all: a source close to the singer said Carey won't require anything out of the ordinary for 'Idol.' Whaaaaaaaaat? Â ""Itâs all standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary,""Â  said the source. ""Itâs not like theyâll need to put a new roof on the building. Itâs standard lists, whether itâs for water, soda, veggies, snacks. Itâs all fairly normal.""

Perhaps motherhood is having big impact on Carey's not-so-divalike behavior? Who can think about a frolicking in a mountain of kittens when you have two crying toddlers to take care of? And since the show has ""its own branded requirements for stars to use the products of certain sponsors,"" maybe her demands will be kept at an all-time low!

Actor Brad Pitt thinks his children are being turned against him and reportedly even stormed out of a meeting with his children.

The Allied actor is concerned that his estranged wife and actor Angelina Jolie is trying to turn their six children -- Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- against him and have even stopped calling him daddy, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

Kris Herzog, a bodyguard who works for both the family and Jolieâs father Jon Voight, says that Pittâs two supervised visits with his brood have not gone well.

âBrad is so angry. From what Iâve heard from Brad and Jon, even the kids are turning against him. Heâs alleging they wonât even speak to him and they wonât call him daddy or father.

2486,"Queen Elizabeth and Kate Middleton Clash Again: Duchess Scared of Difficult Pregnancy, Adopting Second 'Royal' Baby - Reports

Kate Middleton is said to have miscarried. However, a new report claims otherwise. The new report says that it is impossible for Prince George's mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead. In fact, this is one of the things that Kate and Queen Elizabeth are arguing heatedly about.

The Aug. 11th print edition of Life & Style Magazine claims that Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth are in a serious row. This is not because Kate Middleton lost what could have been the baby sister (reportedly!) of Prince George, but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all. The assumption is that Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of Queen Elizabeth, but it seems as if Kate Middleton is rubbing the Queen the wrong way too.

Celeb Dirty Laundry reports that Kate Middleton had it with all the meddling the Queen is doing with her personal affairs, especially on how to raise Prince George and when she should get pregnant again. Even though she originally wanted a lot of kids, having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby. Even though she's not entirely closing her doors to another baby, Kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet.Â  Allegedly, she would rather adopt than have another one!

Because what the Queen wants, the Queen should get, Kate's attitude is making the Queen see red. Â The idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the Queen to a frenzy. Â Royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal family's bloodline would be considered ""a spare"" for the throne, so what Kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off. Kate knows this but she also observes that the Queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy. She is hoping against hope that the Queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home, Celeb Dirty Laundry reports.

This is not the first time that Kate Middleton's ways and ideas crossed the Queen. The Life & Style magazine's July 14 feature ""Tormented by the Queen,"" said the Queen flew into rage when she learned of Middleton's plans to move baby Prince George out of London.

Kate Middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying Prince George rather than plan another baby though. For this summer, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of Mystique. With Prince George now in tow, August will be spent a bit differently.

""The couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishmentsÂ are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate,""Â sharedÂ royal family sources with Vanity Fair.

WhenÂ BeyoncÃ©Â goes into labor, sheâll have one very special helper by her side: 5-year-old daughterÂ Blue Ivy!

According to an insider, the superstar and hubbyÂ Jay Z have agreed to let Blue play nurse

when the singer gives birth to twins, which the insider claims will happen via C-section in June

âBlue will be one of the first to hold the babies, with help from Jay, of course,

and sheâll be responsible for writing down their height and weight,â shares the insider.

âSheâll even get to help tie the ID bracelets on their wrists.â

Though some might be hesitant to have a child in the operating room,

Bey and Jay âwant to make Blue feel included in anything related to bringing the twins into the world,â the insider says.

âSheâs excited â and they donât want her to be jealous.â Paging Nurse Blue!

Angelina Jolieâs rail-thin figure is prompting close pals to call for an intervention to save her from death!

âSheâs refusing to eat!â one concerned insider told The National ENQUIRER. âAngie weighs just 82 pounds and looks absolutely anorexic. If something isnât done soon, sheâll waste away to nothing!

âThereâs no meat on her bones, her eyes are sunken into their sockets and her arms and legs are achingly skinny!â

PHOTOS: Wasting Away! Angelina Jolie Skinnier Than Ever In Shocking New Photos

Angieâs skeletal frame at the L.A. premiere of âKung Fu Panda 3â on Jan. 16 shocked fans everywhere.

Now itâs time for her loved ones, including husband Brad Pitt, to act!

âThey need to make Angie understand the dire straits sheâs in,â the insider said. âHer health situation is going from serious to dire!â

Added Franci Cohen, a New York City nutritionist: âIf she keeps pushing boundaries, her body will shut completely down without further warning.â

After viewing pics of Angie at the event, Dr. Art Mollen of the Mollen Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., said heâd âimmediatelyâ admit a person in her condition to an inpatient behavioral treatment center.

âThis requires a multi-disciplined approach including psychiatrists, cardiologists, nutritionists and even the family to save the personâs life,â Dr. Mollen noted.

âAnyone who has a significantly low body weight like this and consistently abuses their body in this way can cause his or herself major harm,â he explained.

Her prognosis âwould have to be guarded at best. Any time I see a person suffering with what appears to be anorexia, there are deep-seated problems, whether itâs in the marriage or elsewhere.â

Angie, 40, has continually ignored her health as she focuses on her career and humanitarian work, as The ENQUIRER has reported.

PHOTOS: How Will The Stars Look As Time Goes By

But Angie refuses to âslow down her hectic lifestyleâ â although docs have told her she could be a prime candidate to develop cancer if she doesnât look after her health â and even warned her, âYou will die!â â a source said.

The mom of six underwent a preventive double mastectomy in 2013. Sheâs since also had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.

Those surgeries forced her body into early menopause â putting her at a greater risk of a wide array of life-threatening ailments, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

âSometimes she goes a full day without eating a solid meal, and other days sleeps until late afternoon because sheâs so worn out,â said one worried pal.

Another source said: âShe looks incredibly gaunt, her skin is practically translucent. Her hair has thinned out. She looks terribly ill.â

Medical expert Dr. Stuart Fischer said he believes Angie is suffering from cachexia, a wasting syndrome that can dramatically increase the chance of death from an underlying condition.

Brad, 52, is alarmed by his wifeâs appearance, sources said, and has consulted with therapists, dietitians and other experts to help Angie. But she refuses to slow down or take care of herself â even though sheâs so underweight she suffers dizzy spells!

âHeâs at the end of his rope,â a source said.

Itâs time for Angieâs nearest and dearest to stage an intervention, and convince her to get help â before itâs too late â insiders said.

If Selena Gomez seems like sheâs living her best life since reuniting with Justin Bieber â she is! Weâve got the EXCLUSIVE that Selâs in âloveâ and happy to be back with Biebs.


Are Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, the new Beyonce and JAY-Z? To Sel, they are because like JAY and Bey, a Selena insider EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that sheâs âjust so crazy in love with Justin.â Aww. How sweet. Jelena may not cover Bey and JAYâs iconic 2003 hit, âCrazy In Love,â anytime soon, but Selenaâs living the song 24/7. Sheâs even changing the minds of doubters and haters, all with the power of her love.

âAs much as people around her are worried that sheâll end up heartbroken all over again, itâs hard not to be happy for her,â the source tells HollywoodLife.com. âShe tried her best to put things with him behind her and for a long time it seemed like she had. But itâs obvious now that she was carrying a heavy weight around with her this whole time. Now that sheâs back with Justin that weight has lifted, she just seems very light and joyful.â

It seems that Justin feels the same way, as heâs reportedly working on being a âbetter personâ for Selena. Justin, who notoriously left Selenaâs heart broken in two in the past, is reportedly changing his ways to make her happy, which in turn, makes them both happy. Heâs even supposedly considering settling down with Selena in the future. Of course, before he could even consider getting down on one knee, Selena needs to convince her family and friends that heâs legit. Considering the Biebs was absent from the Selena Gomez family Thanksgiving, he may have a ways to go on that.

Selena Gomezâ reacts to The Weekndâ going on a dinner date with Katy Perryâ.
 
Plus, Selenaâs fans may need to find their chill over this Jelena reunion. Justin reportedly âunlikedâ a photo of Selenaâs blonde makeover, which caused Selenators to demand she dump him. Gasp! High treason! (Kidding.) Yeah, calling for these two split seems a bit harsh for a social media slip-up, right? Considering how much Selena is âin loveâ with Justin, perhaps her fans could relax a bit?

Do you think Justin and Selena are going to last, HollywoodLifers? Do you think these two will get hitched or will they end up breaking up, again?

Hoes over bros! Apparently, comedian Chelsea Handler takes that mantra to heart because she is ready to tear into her best friend, Jennifer Garner's ex, Ben Affleck. The 42-year-old is 100 percent #TeamJen in the Ben/Jen split â and honestly, can you blame her? In Touch has the exclusive scoop on what exactly Chelsea has in store for the Argo star.


Sources say Chelsea ""is foaming at the mouth wanting to publicly unload on her good friendâs lying and cheating estranged husband, Ben."" During a July 12 dinner with Jen (at the same restaurant where Ben took Lindsay six days earlier), ""Chelsea was focused on getting Jenâs blessing to go after Ben.""

Much to Chelsea's disappointment, we're sure, it looks like her takedown of Ben is going to need to be put on hold. Understandably, Jen doesn't want any more unnecessary attention on her family. The source continues, ""But while Jen is extremely appreciative, she isnât comfortable with it. She thinks it will just create more drama.â

This behavior isn't surprising coming from Chelsea. She was incredibly vocal about her support of friend Jennifer Aniston after her very public split from ex-husband, Brad Pitt.

While appearing on Watch What Happens Live she was asked what she'd do if ever stuck in an elevator with Angelina Jolie. ""I would just look up,â the late night host said. âExactly what people do in elevators. You know when you fake look at the number because you donât want to make eye contact.

Kanye West Enraged Taylor Swift Referenced Kim Kardashianâs Robbery In Music Video

Kanye West was emotionally unaffected by Taylor Swiftâs âLook What You Made Me Doâ videoâ¦ until she seemingly referenced Kim Kardashianâs 2016 Paris robbery. The rapper thinks it was a pretty low thing for Taylor to do.


Kanye West, 40, isnât too happy that Taylor Swift, 27, targeted Kim Kardashianâs Paris robbery situation in her music video for âLook What You Made Me Doâ, HL has EXCLUSIVELY learned. âHe was upset that Taylor exploited Kimâs robbery,â a source close to the rapper explains. âKanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.â Ultimately, Yeâ âjust feels as though itâs something that Taylor shouldnât have mocked.â


As for the rest of the video? â Well, Kanye could care less. He and Kim, 36, werenât bothered by the cryptic messages in the video that the internet consumed themselves with, trying to dissect. However, it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset. As you may know, Kim was robbed of her multi-million dollar, 20-carat engagement ring, at gunpoint in Oct. 2016; as well as other personal items. The traumatic experience caused Kim longterm emotional struggles, which she still deals with to this day.

However, sheâs admitted that the robbery was âmeantâ to happen to her. âI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,â Kim said through tears on Ellen [April, 2017]. âI know that was so meant to happen to me. Iâm such a different person â¦ I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.â

In case [for some reason] you didnât watch Taylorâs âLook What You Made Me Doâ music video, we can help you decode the whole assumed robbery reference. At one point in the extremely cryptic video, Taylor lays in a bathtub, filled with diamonds.

When Kim was robbed, she said she was attacked in her Paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged.

Then, Taylor makes a gun-notion with her hand and pretends to cock it back with her hands.

Kim was robbed at gunpoint.

Later on in the video, Taylor, along with a group of accomplices, all wearing cat masks and hoodies, are seen viciously tearing through a closet, while stuffing money into bags.

When Kim was robbed, she described the scene as French men rummaging through her things, looking for money, jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers.

So, was Taylor really mocking the traumatic experience Kim endured? You can be the judge of that one. However, weâve decoded the video [seen above] to give you a clearer look at Tayâs new work.

""Kanye [West]'s talking more and more about stepping into politics, but Kim [Kardashian] is extremely hesitant for him to go down that path. She's very nervous about the kind of hatred that would be focused on him and their family if he were to run for president. Before the robbery, she wasn't as scared, but now she lives in constant fear. If Kanye runs for president, those fears will explode,"" a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

We can totally understand why Kim would be so worried. If she thinks she's under a microscope now, just wait until she's First Lady. The haters would never stop coming for her. And Kim doesn't deserve that, especially after her Paris robbery in early October. That was scary enough!

We're not exactly sure what Kanye plans to do if he's elected President, but what we do know is that had he voted this year, he would have supported Donald Trump.

""I told y'all I didn't vote, right? But I didn't tell you, I guess I'll tell you, but if I were to vote, I would've votedÂ Trump,"" he told concert goers on Nov. 17.

""There was things that I liked about Trump's campaign"" he added, before explaining this is theÂ ""beginning of change.""

2416,"Miley Cyrus Wedding Rumors: Will Miley Force Liam Hemsworth To Sign A Prenup?

Wedding rumors for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are heating up, and now many fans want to know if either party plans to protect their assets before tying the knot. Miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her Aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants Liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. Life & Style has reported that Miley's money demands have caused stress in her relationship with Liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary.

Miley Cyrus is worth a whopping $160 million while Liam boasts just $16 million himself. Life & Style claims that Miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $176 million as they head toward marriage. Apparently, it doesn't matter to Miley if everything about her relationship with Liam seems perfect right now. Cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in 2013. Miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with Liam doesn't stand the test of time.

""They've had heated arguments over this,"" a source told the magazine. ""He's a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it's not needed. He's assured Miley he isn't interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own.""

It's only fair that Miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry Liam. Cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make Hemsworth happy. It was Miley's wild ways that pushed Liam away the first time around. Now that Liam and Miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and Miley isn't acting out nearly as much as she was in past years.

On the other hand, Liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, Miley is the woman that he loves. While Miley has toned it down some, Liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self.

After reports that Miley moved in with Liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. Us Magazine reports that Miley just put $2.5 million down on a 4-bedroom home in Malibu. ""The plan is for Liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he's ready,"" a source close to Cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. It's unclear why Miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with Liam, not far away. Now, the pair own a pair of Malibu homes. Could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together 24 hours a day?

So far, neither Miley nor Liam are talking about their reconciliation. Then again, they aren't hiding their love either. Ever since Miley was spotted in Australia during the New Year's holiday, she and Liam have been seen spending time together. There have even been reports that mutual friend Kellan Lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about Liam purchasing a new ring for Miley. Not to mention that Cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on Instagram already.

Will the prenup continue to be an issue for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth? Fans hope not and many are excited that Miley has her man back. Let's just hope this new Miley is still fun and outrageous, and that Liam doesn't tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.

The Hunger Games actress recently went to the showbiz matriarch's house for dinner but things quickly escalated and she ended up stripping off in the 61-year-old star's closet and asking her daughter Kim Kardashian West, and the reality star's husband Kanye West, to dress her.

While interviewing Kim during a guest hosting stint on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she told the audience: ""I drank five martinis and wound up naked in her closet, Iâm dead serious.""

Kim admitted the evening with the 27-year-old actress was the most under the influence she had ever seen her mother before.

She said: ""So Jennifer came over for dinner two weeks ago, Iâve never seen my mom more drunk in our lives. It was so funny. They had a few too many drinks for my taste.""

Kim - who has 22-month-old son Saint and four-year-old daughter North with the 40-year-old rapper - was shocked to see her pal ""fully butt naked"" in her mother's wardrobe.

Recalling the night, she explained: ""You said, âIâm not joking, I really want Kanye to style me,' and so I said, âOK.â

2586,"Jim Carrey Claims Donald Trump Is A 'Reptilian-Illuminati Blood Prince'

Jim CarreyÂ has told fans and supporters that Donald Trump is not human but is a âreptilian that shapeshifts between human and reptile formâ and he has witnessed the president shapeshift âin the flesh, before my very eyes, and in my opinion, as personal warning to me.â

Speaking to supporters at the Signature Gallery in Las Vegas where he is hosting his first ever art exhibition, âSunshowerâ, the beloved comedic actor dropped hints about the themes buried deep in his paintings.

âI am interested in what is behind the veil of reality, the real power structures that control the universe. Iâm no longer interested in the daily facade. Iâve put everything I know into these paintings.â

Carrey first met Donald Trump at a boxing match held at theÂ Trump Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City in the early 90s. A popular TV actor at the time, Carrey was criticized by Trumpâs associates for âfailing to entertainâ the future president.

But according to Carrey, he was âavoiding him like the plagueâ because he witnessed Trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue.

âDonald Trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,â Carrey said.

Explaining that Donald Trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form âat least three timesâ while greeting him, Carrey claims that he also saw Trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests.

âHis hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable. When he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewel-encrusted daggers.â

âIt wasnât just me.Â Iâm not going to name names, but these secrets are well known in certain circles, among those in the know.â

Carrey says he believes Trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilian-political Illuminati of which he is a âblood prince.â

âThis branch of the Illuminati, the most powerful branch, they come from Bavaria,â Carrey said, explaining that âBavaria is Trumpâs ancestral homeland.â

Asked if he had proof of his claims, Carrey told his supporters to âwatch what happens when these issues get raised in the media. The gatekeepers will try to deny I said these things. When that doesnât work, they will try and destroy my reputation.â

Carrey also told his fans and supporters to âlook deeplyâ at his artworks to âdecipher their real meaning.â

âThere are some things you canât say, but you can paint. I have put everything I know into those paintings.â

âItâs 1am, Iâm eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends. Iâve never felt more at peace,â Carrey said.

Carreyâs first hand experiences with the reptilian-Illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts.Â  I have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over 80 countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing âpeopleâ briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes.

Iâve been told this by Californian news anchors, Ethiopian goatherds, and Australian Aboriginals, just to name a few.Â  A Danish taxi driver described driving past a group of VIP guests at the 2014 Bilderberg meeting in Copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look.

In Peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power, like Obama, David Cameron and Hillary Clinton, turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel.

The worldâs ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media, as well as our food, water, and air supply, and they are actively dumbing down the masses.Â  The evidence against them, ancient and modern, is enormous and continuing to grow.

Thereâs no denying that Beyonce is one of Hollywoodâs biggest divaâs but new sources suggest her demands just got even crazier. In anticipation of the arrival of their beloved twins, the singer and her husband Jay-Z have concocted a delivery plan so insane youâd think theyâre royalty. On the heels of reports that the famous couple have moved to a rental property close to Los Angelesâ Cedars-Sinai hospital, where Beyâs due to give birth, insiders tell Heat magazine that âthe event is set to be a no-expense-spared extravaganza.â Click through to get the scoop inside Beyonceâs delivery room plans, and how the coupleâs daughter, Blue Ivy, will have a very peculiar role in the process.

âBey and Jay want three suites in the hospital- they only had one for Blue. This will give their people space and allow for security, who are needed because people will inevitably try to sneak in and take pictures of the twins,â a source tells the tabloid. Understandably, the duo are ânot taking any chances.âÂ BT45tW4A8mR

And whatâs more is that the famous parents have asked their five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, to help deliver the twins. âBeyonce has decided Blue will be part of the delivery process to make sure sheâs not jealous of her new siblings. Blue has her own birth plan written up, and will be staying in the room throughout. Sheâs set to be the first person to hold the babies after the doctor handing them to Jay-Z.âÂ BTrg0rEg9gY

The insider continues, âBlueâs got $1,200 Givenchy nurseâs outfit, and a notepad to write down the twinsâ weights. She will also help to tie the identification bracelets on their wrists.â Sources tell the outlet that Blue âisnât nervous about seeing her mum give birth â quite the opposite. Sheâs really excited.âÂ BTN6tgmAC-W

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that devote Scientologist Jenna Elfman had Katie Holmes cowering in fearÂ Â behind the scenes when the two both appeared on the Mar. 29 broadcast.

""Jenna was doing the show live to promote her new ABC show,"" Imaginary Mary, revealed an onset source. ""She was happy and charming and the audience loved her.""

""It was one of the ugliest and nastiest things I've ever seen a human being do and to this day I just can't stand her,"" recalled one former Scientologist who left the church and claimed Elfman confronted her.

Holmes, 38, was labeled a suppressive person and shunned by the Scientology community, including 45-year-old Elfman, following her bitter divorce from the religion's highest star-powered devotee, Tom Cruise.

""Katie got out of the religion and knows everything, and she wants nothing to do with Scientology,"" an insider explained of the awkward morning show situation.

Ellen DeGeneres' obsession with staying forever young is written all over her faceÂ  â literally! In a new report from The National ENQUIRER, sources reveal that the down-to-earth talk show queen is really a plastic surgery junkie in disguise.

And according to insiders, her much-younger gorgeous wife Portia de Rossi is her inspiration for the drastic measures.

""She's had plastic surgery,"" one TV mole told the mag. ""I think she's had it before and it's all because she's unhappy about looking older â especially when compared to Portia [de Rossi]!""

And, according to another behind-the-scenes snitch, her glowing appearance isn't just TV magic.

""She had a lift and still gets Botox! She drives her hair and makeup staff nuts!"" continued the source.

A production insider revealed the challenges her glam team face when it comes to concealing scarring due to the work she's had done: ""It usually takes them about two-and-a-half hours to give Ellen that peaches-and-cream glow her fans love,"" said the source.

So just what has she had done?

Top plastic surgeons examined photos of the comedienne and say the CoverGirl spokeswoman appears to have a multitude of procedures, including face-, eye-, neck- and brow-lifts.

""There is a dramatic change that made her look somewhat different,"" leading NYC cosmetic surgeon Dr. Yoel S. Shahar, who has not treated DeGeneres, told The ENQUIRER. ""To achieve such a change she needed to have multiple procedures. It is quite obvious she underwent a full facelift that improved her neck and jawline.

And if that wasn't enough, DeGeneres' journey to find the fountain of youth allegedly didn't end there.

Dr. Shahar suggested the 56-year-old appears to have had upper and lower blepharoplasty, which ""smooth and improve the eyelid, giving her a youthful look.

Famed cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Kenneth Mark, who has not treated the Emmy Award-winning TV host, added: ""She has been transformed from having a frown face with sunken cheeks under her eyes and jowls with prominent marionette lines to now looking alive and well!""

2553,"Malia Obama Has Barack And Michelle Worried â Can She Handle Life Alone In New York City?

Malia Obama, 18, is adjusting to her new life outside of the White House and the changes are not easy to handle for her famous parents â former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

The young woman is busy mixing up a prestigious internship at the Weinstein & Co. offices in Manhattan and cool nights with friends on the town.

The former first daughter is expected to attend Harvard University in the fall. All seems to be going well, but a negative story about Malia trying to beat up a right-wing journalist, allegedly, of course, has her parents worried.

She was also spotted having a fun time with a young man who was later identified as Rob Franklin.

Those headlines raised a lot of questions in some circles, and the power couple is reportedly not immune to the intense chatter.

Is she mature enough to handle life in this big place? Should they be more present in the life of the teenager at this crucial juncture?

Sources close to the Obamas have started talking to the media and describing the dilemma they are facing when it comes to their oldest child.

An insider spoke to a celebrity news website and stated: âMalia [Obama]âs parents totally trust her and know she has a good head on her shoulders, but itâs still hard for them to let go.â

The person added: âThey understand that sheâs spreading her wings, that sheâs bound to make some mistakes and theyâre okay with that. But as much as they trust her they canât help but worry about her. Sheâs living in the big city all alone and in their eyes sheâs still a kid.â

Although it is always hard to tell if those so-called insiders really know what they are talking about, however, the statement above appears plausible.

Jennifer Lopez gets cozy with on-screen boyfriend Milo Ventimiglia
2017-11-07T01:52:40+0000
She's had many a handsome leading man in her romantic comedies.

And Jennifer Lopez added another dashing co-star to her repertoire as she was spotted filming with Milo Ventimiglia on Monday.

The superstar, 48, looked casual chic in an off-the-shoulder sweater as the two actors shot a romantic date scene for Second Act.

Daring to impress, Jennifer was seen walking to set in a fur-lined black parka over a grey sweater and camouflage pants.

Her trademark chestnut tresses were left long and loose as they cascaded over her petite shoulders.

The Shades Of Blue actress turned on the charm as she looked deeply into Milo's eyes over glasses of red wine in the Italian restaurant.

Sporting his usual mustache, the This Is Us hunk, 40, rocked a grey button down as he seemed in serious conversation with his dinner date.

Second Act has Jennifer returning to her romantic comedy roots that made her a household name.

Peter Segal will direct the film - which was developed by STXfilms with Jennifer from an idea conceived by Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Justin Zackham.

The movie is in the vein of Maid In Manhattan - a huge hit for Jennifer - and Working Girl - the Oscar winning comedy from 1988.

Jennifer will play a big-box store employee who reinvents her life and gets the chance to prove that street smarts are as valuable as a college degree.

Leah Remini is attached to portray the best friend and fellow employee of Jennifer's character while Vanessa Hudgens will play a boss at a consumer goods company.

Dan Bucatinsky, Annaleigh Ashford, and Freddie Stroma round out the cast.

Second Chance is scheduled to debut at the end of 2018.

Plastic surgery experts previously spoke to Life & Style about Nicole's transformation, and revealed the procedures they believe she's had done based on her changing appearance.

""The likely fillers around Nicole's mouth look very good,"" observed plastic surgeon Dr. Lyle Back, who has never worked with Nicole. He suspected the Aussie's tight jawline and smooth neck came courtesy of a mini face-lift. Added Dr. Mirwat Sami, Botox seems to have smoothed Nicole's crow's-feet and the ""11s between her brows... but her eyelids look heavy.""

The tipster added: âTheir first home together is the beginning of what they hope will be a very long life together. They have both grown up so much.

Jennifer Hudsonâs first season as a coach on the NBCâs The Voice will likely be her last, as RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that her âdiva anticsâ were just way too much handle for the cast and crew!

After winning the U.K. version of the hit reality singing competition show, Hudson, 36, joined Miley Cyrus, 24, Adam Levine, 38, and Blake Shelton, 41, for season 13 of the U.S. version.

According to a well-connected production source, Hudson and Sheltonâs bickering was a huge problem for producers!

âBlake cannot stand Jennifer at all. The two are constantly at war both on-camera and off-camera and it has gotten to the point where he cannot even talk to her or look at her,â the source said.

But it isnât only Sheltonâs feathers that Hudson has ruffled! âShe is also hated among the crew too,â the insider dished to Radar.

âJennifer does not show up on time and is a complete diva when she does. She is constantly complaining about her outfits and is always unhappy with her hair and make-up,â spills the behind-the-scenes snitch.

âBut honestly there is only so much that they can do!â

Lately, Hudson has been constantly plugging her own production company, JHud Productions, from her judging chair.

According to officialÂ Air Force records, the battling Obamas used both Air Force One and a Boeing C-32A - the military equivalent of a Boeing 757. The second plane was apparently used to transport the First Lady so that she didn't have to travel with her Presidential spouse!

That helped to boost the costs of the strained couple's Christmas vacation to a total of $3,590,313.60! Michelle was travelingÂ in style, too!

The Air Force's fact sheet revealed that the luxury plane features ""a fully-enclosed stateroom,"" plus ""a changing area, private lavatory, separate entertainment system, two first-class swivel seats and a convertible divan that seats three and folds out to a bed.""

The ENQUIRER has already revealed how the angry First Lady has earned the nickname ""Monster Michelle"" from staffers who watch in fear as she often goes on the warpath!

Michelle also ignored the taxpayers when she stormed off for a trip to China with her mother and daughters - putting aside Obama's concerns over cost.

Insiders told The ENQUIRER that Michelle (seen here in France)Â couldn't stand to be around her husband after the president took an embarrassing ""selfie"" photo with sexy Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial service!

Things got worse for Barack after Michelle discovered a secret love nest kept by her husband! Multiple insiders confirmed to The ENQUIRER that Obama was a regular at the swanky Jefferson Hotel, located a few blocks from the White House.

We have learned that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is still unable to wear her jewelry.

As fans may already be aware, ever since she was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris suite last year, Kim has been battling panic attacks and anxiety that rendered her homebound for months.

When she finally returned to her public life, the Kardashian seemed a whole different person â a lot more modest and reserved than usual.

Her trauma over the robbery that could have cost her her life has even led Kardashian to attend therapy in order to cope with the trauma.

But despite the fact that her therapist is of great help, they are still figuring out how to fix her accessories issue.

For now, the only solution is to wear as little jewelry as possible.

Is Kim Kardashian trying to steal Kanye West's money along with his fame? According to a new report from Star, Kim is treating her prenup to Kanye like a business transaction, which is probably a smart decision. Let's be realistic â how long is this marriage going to last? Two years? Five years? She's already gone through this rodeo once, and she knows that eventually, she'll end up getting Kanye's money if she plays her cards right. The only question is â how much?

Kanye is reportedly worth $100 million whereas Kim is only worth $40 million, and so Kim is supposedly trying to, 'take as much of Kanye's fortune as possible'. A source explains, ""Kim and Kris [Jenner] apparently want a $10 million cheating clause in the prenup too, in the event that the marriage ends due to the rapper's wandering eye. KrisÂ wants Kim to get $5 million a year for each year they're married, plus a $20 million bonus if they last five years.""

Kanye's so whipped that he might actually go for this, and you know that five years down the line, Kris is going to make sure Kim will cash in that $20 bonus. Like, her daughter's happiness? Please, she would rather have the $20 million.

And although we've discussed Kim's demands, Kanye's supposed demands are even more ridiculous. Star claims that Kanye will include something called a 'classy clause', which will, ""prevent Kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings."" Well, I wouldn't count on that lasting, especially since there's only so long Kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage.

Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom's Funeral

Kanye West just snapped a week ago Monday in what we're told was a ""nervous breakdown"" ... triggered in large part by the anniversary of his mother's death.

Sources very close to Kanye tell TMZ ... he was increasingly becoming a powder keg of emotions in the weeks leading up to his hospitalization at the UCLA Medical Center ... fueled by what we're told was a shocking lack of sleep and the pressures of touring, running his businesses, parenting and providing emotional support to his wife who was suffering her own emotional trauma after the Paris robbery.

But our sources say the trigger for the breakdown was Donda's death back in November 2007. Her funeral was November 20 -- the same day he cancelled his show at the L.A. Forum. The following day -- November 21 -- Kanye cancelled the remainder of the tour and hours later suffered the breakdown.

People close to Kanye tell us he never effectively grieved over his mom's death and has always had a difficult time in November, but this time he reached the breaking point.

Kanye, we're told, has had trouble handling stress over the last few months, and in the week or so before the breakdown he started to unravel.

As we reported ... Kanye became paranoid when he was taken to UCLA ... refusing for a time to even let doctors touch him. He also ranted that people were trying to ruin his marriage.

Kanye was sedated and is being treated by doctors and mental health professionals. Doctors hoped to release him 2 days ago, but that didn't happen and so far ... no new release date.

""But now that he's in hot pursuit of a new wife, he wants Suri back in his life. He misses having a family.""

Tom apparently got inspired to reconnect with his daughter after a reporter asked him Suri's about future. Recently, a reporter asked Tom whether Suri will follow his and Katie Holmes'Â footsteps and enter the entertainment industry. Though he replied, ""You never know,"" the question sparked something in the father.

""The reporter's question triggered something in Tom and made him want to reconnect with Suri even more,"" the source said, adding, ""It's happening.""

However, Gossip Cop has debunked the report and reported that the reunion between the father and the daughter is not happening and the magazine reports are false.

In March, there were a few reports suggesting that the actor misses being with a family after his mother's death and wants to reconnect with his youngest daughter. However, the father-daughter reunion has not happened until now.

So, what do you think will Tom Cruise meet his daughter Suri Cruise?

Already ailing Angelina Jolieâs wildly energetic brood is acting up big time behind the scenes â and it may be putting her health at risk, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively!

A worried pal reveals the globe-trotting actress has been trying to keep her six kids â Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne â happy with âshopping trips and fancy toys and gadgets, but the truth is theyâre going stir crazy because theyâre cooped up at home 24/7.â

Whatâs more, says the source, the children are âdesperately missing their dadâ Brad Pitt.

âThese kids got very used to traveling the world; living out of a suitcase was the norm for themâ spills the snitch, âNow itâs a boring life by comparison and theyâre acting up.â

The independent mother-of-six thinks she can do it all on her own, claims the informant, and is âpushing people away who try to help, even her dad and brother.â

âSheâs neglecting her diet again and barely sleeping with all the worry and dysfunction thatâs going on.â

2548,"Ryan Gosling says he gave up smoking after filming The Nice Guys

It's a bad habit that many people struggle to kick.

But Ryan Gosling seems to have found the best way to quit smoking once and for all, and according to him, it actually works.

The 35-year-old actor told Australian radio hosts,Â Kyle And Jackie O,Â on Tuesday that he 'smoked himself out' whilst filming The Nice Guys, in which he plays a private investigator Holland March, who is addicted to cigarettes.

Admitting he was a smoker in real life before filming, the father-of-two revealed he has since quit after being turned off by smoking too much.

'I use to, but in this movie I smoked myself out,' he laughed, adding: 'I never want another cigarette again!'

'It really is the greatest way to quit - it's hard to come by - you really have to get a film where you have to smoke all the time, but I highly recommend it if you are trying to quit,' he went on.

As well as smoking a lot for the film, the Hollywood star also revealed he drank a lot too - largely due to the influence of his co-star Russell Crowe.

'InÂ terms of the drinking, I am supposed to be drunk all the time in the film, but it actually worked out because I went out with Russell right before we started shooting, so I was still drunk the entire shoot,' he said.

He went on to add: 'So I never had to play drunk once, I was 'Scooby Doo-py' all day long thanks to him!' he joked.

During the chat, Ryan spoke of the close friendship he formed with the Australian star during filming, and says Russell introduced him to some iconic Aussie traits.

'God bless him he tried to teach me about Rugby,' the actor said.

'He was also pumping me with these Australian ginger beer and vodka while he was trying to teach me,' he added.

Kyle was quick to interject, saying: 'That's not very Australian! I don't think I know anyone who drinks that!'

However, Ryan wasn't having any of it, responding: 'Hey listen to me... If Rusty says it's Australian, it's Australian! You understand?'

The two stars are currently on the promotional trail for The Nice Guys.

Russell plays a contract killer to Ryan's private investigator in the film, with the pair working together to solve the mysterious disappearance of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.

The film is scheduled to hit cinemas in Australia next week.

Angelina Jolie is going back to her roots â and demanding everyone around her speak French!

A snitch told The National ENQUIRER the 41-year-old mother of six, whose maternal grandfather was French-Canadian, has become obsessed with all things French â and has made sure the children she shares with her ex Brad Pitt are fluent in the language as well!

âAngie is extremely sentimental at the moment â meeting up with her estranged dad after years is proof of that,â disclosed a confidant. âBut this French thing, itâs all about trying to feel close to her late mother.â

While those in Angieâs camp are sympathetic, theyâre also annoyed with her new linguistic preference because most of them donât speak the language â and donât plan on learning it anytime soon!

âItâs driving everyone crazy, but sheâs trying to find something to cling to right now â and her motherâs heritage is it,â spilled another tipster. âThe problem is she comes across as someone completely out of touch â and selfish!â

2519,"Leah Remini Opens Up About Her Friendship With Jennifer Lopez And The Scientology Connection

Jennifer Lopez and ex-Scientologist Leah Remini are the best of friends. They have known each other for several years and have been through a lot. Come what may, their friendship weathers through. It has always seemed that Leah was the only one with a Church of Scientology connection, but that isnât the case.

In a recent interview with People, Leah Remini shared how her friend Jennifer Lopez fits into the Scientology equation. While Jennifer isnât a member of the Church of Scientology herself, her father David is. He has been in the church for over 30 years. When Leah left the Church of Scientology, she was lucky that her husband Angelo Pagan, her daughter Sofia, and her mother Vicky all came with her. A topic she has covered on her A&E Emmy-nominated show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, is âdisconnecting.â

When a member of the Church of Scientology decides to leave the religion, their friends and family that are still in the church are no longer to have contact with them. This is called disconnecting. Now, while the churchâs rebuttal is that no one is forced to disconnect and that it is a choice, viewers of her show understand how serious disconnection is taken.

Leah shared that actually, her friend Jennifer Lopez could be in danger of disconnection for remaining her friend. The way the Church of Scientology believes, David Lopez, being an active member, should disconnect from Jennifer because of her continuing connection to Leah. She did imply that it is enforced more for members who are not such âbig names.â Considering she left the Church of Scientology in 2013, it appears there have been no repercussions for their friendship.

The Church of Scientology took offense to her observations and responded by bashing Leahâs show where she takes on the church. The few times the church has responded to Leah Remini, it has always been to refute all claims their ex-believer has made. They say she is lying, staging the show, and all other ex-members who are on her show are just as dishonest. Leah remains dedicated to exposing the church and the leaders.

2456,"Billy Bush's wife is 'furious' at him after Trump interview leak

Billy Bush may have just posted a new selfie with his wife, but rumors are swirling that all is not well back in their California paradise.

The recently-fired Today Show host has moved back to Los Angeles after his now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood interview with Donald Trump was leaked.

But sources told Page Six that Sydney Davis, Bush's wife of 18 years, is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters.

'She was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while,' an NBC insider told the site. 'They are having marriage problems.'

In the tape, Bush can be heard calling actress Arianne Zucker 'hot as s***,' and also saying nothing while Trump makes lewd comments about his co-host Nancy O'Dell.

But the moment that really angered Davis, a source claims, was when Bush, after gawking at Zucker's legs, asked her if she would give him and the Donald 'a little hug'.

'It wasn't just the vile talk,' the source said. 'It's because he insisted the woman hug him and Trump. It was creepy.'

Bush, 45, later released an apology for the interview and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed', but did not make any mention of Davis.

'I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,' he said in the statement. 'I'm very sorry.'

The source said Davis is enraged that Bush 'was stupid enough to put himself in that position' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig.

'Billy has brought him on himself,' they said. 'He's blown his big chance at Today and he doesn't have his old job at Access [Hollywood] to fall back on.'

'He fears his career is over. His wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.'

Bush refused to comment on the article to Page Six, telling the site: 'I cannot take this call.'

Davis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on Saturday she did reappear on her husband's Instagram.

Bush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving The Today Show, posting a picture of him and Davis in the great outdoors.

'Hiking with lady long legs,' he wrote in the caption. 'Nice to get out.'

It was the first photo Bush, 45, had shared on Instagram in three weeks.

Davis features prominently in Bush's Instagram, most recently visiting him in New York with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal.

'Teaching the squad about the NYC Subway ONLY way to go,' Bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word 'squad'.

In another photo him and Davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo.

Bush, who worked at Access Hollywood for 15 years, had only held his new job at Today for two months when he was given the boot following the Trump scandal.

Matt Lauer confirmed Bush's contract had been terminated 'effective immediately' on an episode of the Today Show last week.

Lauer closed out by saying: 'All of us here at Today wish Billy the very best.'

Tamron Hall also acknowledged Bush's departure later in the show, saying: 'As a longtime member of the NBC family, we wish Billy all the best as he moves forward.'

Bush said in a statement following the announcement that he was 'deeply grateful' for the conversations he'd had with his three teenage daughters.

'I look forward to what lies ahead,' he added.

Although speculation has swirled regarding where Bush might go next - including to the rumored future Trump TV - he has not yet confirmed his next step.

Instead it seems Bush has been busy trying to return to life in Los Angeles, even putting up his luxury Manhattan townhouse on the market for $8.2million.

Bush had purchased the building for $8.8million just last December.

It was initially reported that Bush walked away from NBC with $10million, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate.

Instead it is believed NBC would only pay some of the remainder of Bush's $3million-a-year contract, according to CNN Money.

Exact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush can look for jobs at rivals stations.

Bush's attorney Marshall Grossman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the interview with Trump, saying that Bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at Trump's statements and made lewd comments of his own.

'If Billy had been passive or responded ""Shut the f*** up"" to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,' said Grossman.

But one source told the Daily Mail Online that Bush had bragged about the tape while covering the Olympics this summer in Rio.

'What is stunning is how self-important Billy is,' the source said.

'Many people believe Access Hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting Billy while not doing the right thing and informing NBC News.'

2556,"Is Angelina Jolie Nemesis Chelsea Handler Getting Close To Brad Pitt After Heartbreaking Split?

We did not see this coming. Angelina Jolieâs worst Hollywood enemy, Chelsea Handler, might be getting a little too close to former lover Brad Pitt, according to a new report. Ouch!


Itâs no secret that Chelsea Handler, 42, has never been a fan of Angelina Jolie. In fact, sheâs been team Jennifer Aniston since the beginning. But now, the web of friendship and rivalry is all tangled up following a seriously shocking report from Naughty Gossip. The publication claims that the comedian is getting close to Brad Pitt, which kindaâ seems like a stab in the back for both Angie and the Friends alum. If true, how twisted is that?! âChelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer,â a source tells Naughty Gossip on Aug. 17. âShe always blamed Angelina for the nasty split. But now that she isnât friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad.â

Huhâ¦apparently the bond between Chelsea and Jen wasnât unbreakable like we once thought. But would the talkshow hostess really betray her (former) friend like that? Would things would Brad actually turn romantic? For now it sounds like Chelsea is only interested in collaborating with the Fight Club hunk professionally. âChelsea has long been a fan of Bradâs âPlan Bâ production company and is talking with them about a few projects,â the source continues. âDonât be surprised if we see Brad and Chelsea having lunch together soon!â

We know what youâre thinking â when the heck did Chelsea and Jen stop being friends?! It was less than a year ago that the Horrible Bosses actress appeared on her show to gush about hubby Justin Theroux. âHow was your Thanksgiving? Did you get a surprise?â asked Chelsea. âI did! I got a surprise! My husband!â Jen replied. The women had an absolute blast talking about the holidays, with no sign of a strained relationship. Never get a guy come between a friendship!


HollywoodLifers, do you think Chelsea and Brad would ever seriously date? Or is that too weird?

2570,"Harvey Weinstein plans to sue New York Times for $50M

Harvey Weinstein says he will sue the New York Times for an estimated $50 million after it published a bombshell report claiming the movie mogul subjected actresses and female staffers to âdecades of sexual harassment.â

Weinstein has hired Charles J. Harder â the LA attorney who brought down Gawker after winning a $140 million verdict for Hulk Hogan after the site posted a sex tape â to go after the Times, which posted its blistering exposÃ© on the Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul Thursday.

Harder said in a statement on behalf of Weinstein, exclusively given to Page Six, âThe New York Times published today a story that is saturated with false and defamatory statements about Harvey Weinstein. It relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by 9 different eyewitnesses. We sent the Times the facts and evidence, but they ignored it and rushed to publish. We are preparing the lawsuit now. All proceeds will be donated to womenâs organizations.â

Harder did not say how much they planned to sue for, but sources said Weinstein would go after the publication for as much as $50 million.

Weinstein denies the accounts given by several female former employees to the Times, as well as details given by actress Ashley Judd, who says the mogul lured her up to his hotel room, where she alleged he appeared in a bathrobe and asked her to massage him or watch him shower.

The Times also reported that the powerful co-founder of Miramax negotiated at least eight payouts to women to keep them quiet, by asking them to sign confidentiality agreements barring them from speaking about the alleged harassment.

Among them were a young assistant in New York in 1990, âCharmedâ actress Rose McGowan in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and, most recently, Lauren OâConnor, who documented some of the womenâs complaints, the Times said.

In a statement Thursday to The Post through attorney Lisa Bloom, Weinstein said, âI came of age in the â60s and â70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned itâs not an excuse, in the office â or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way Iâve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.â

Weinstein added heâs working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence from his company to âdeal with this issue head on.â

Weinstein is being advised by Bloom, who is a famed advocate for women.

James Wan started filming for Aquaman in Australia last month. While Jason Momoa and Mera actress Amber Heard have already shot their first scene together, Queen Atlanna actress Nicole KidmanÂ reached a few days ago. Following her landing, there have reportedly been feud sparks on the sets.

The actress, who will be seen playing Momoa's mother in the movie, recently shared that she was excited to take on the role of the female warrior,Â but it looks like she does not like Heard's presence on the sets.

Also Read: Is something brewing between Aquaman Jason Momoa & Nicole Kidman on sets of DC movie?

According to a report by National Enquirer, it seems like there is an epic clash in making. The report claims that Kidman is not treating Heard like others on the set. The website's source shares that she has been giving Heard a cold treatment since the pre-production stage. But why?

National Enquirer claims that it has to do with Heard's divorce with Kidman's dear friend Johnny Depp. ""Nicole didn't like how Amber treated [her friend] Johnny Depp during their divorce,"" the source told the outlet.

""It doesn't help that [Kidman] has little respect for Amber as an actress,"" or that her role in the movie is ""bigger"" than Kidman's. ""She thinks Amber's getting by on social climbing and good looks rather than talent,"" adds the report. The website's source also added that Heard's ""forceful personality"" will ""guaranteed snap"" when Kidman arrives on set.

However, Gossip Cop's shares that there is no truth in these claims. Debunking the bogus claim, the website assures that the news is indeed fake.

The gossip website reached out to the Big Little Lies star and her rep guaranteed that there is no truth in the made claims. They also write that another source from the Aquaman movie sets shares with them that there are no issues between the two actresses.

While that has ended the possible speculations, new video shared by Heard show how much she is working out and preparing for her scenes in the movie. In a boomerang video she shared on Instagram, the actress is seen cart-wheeling with her trainer on the sets.

Whereas, Jason Momoa is busy rock climbing as he shares more videos from his training camp.

Aquaman is currently being filmed in Gold Coast in Australia and is slated for release on December 21, 2018.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are reportedly ""getting married"" in August 2017.

According to a new report, Selena Gomez and her singer boyfriend, who are currently enjoying time together in Buenos Aires, are allegedly planning to make their relationship official after he wraps his Starboy: Legend of the Fall 2017 World Tour in August.

""[Selena Gomez] knows The Weeknd is her soul mate and doesn't want to spend years waiting to get married,"" a source told In Touch Weekly for their April 10 issue, via Hollywood Life.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have only been dating publicly for a few months, but according to the report, Gomez is moving forward full steam when it comes to planning their alleged wedding.

""[Selena Gomez] already has a wedding dress in mind,"" the source explained. ""She wants something classic; white, long and fitted to show off her amazing body. She's yet to choose a designer, but Versace, Giorgio Armani and Marchesa are at the top of her list.""

The In Touch Weekly insider claimed Selena Gomez and The Weeknd had several locations in mind for their potential wedding, including Lake Como in Italy, Venice, Florence and Paris. As fans may recall, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd embarked on a tour of Italy weeks after they confirmed their relationship with a joint outing in Los Angeles.

As for who may be in attendance at Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's allegedly upcoming nuptials, the magazine's insider claimed the pair was planning to keep things intimate.

""[Selena Gomez] and The Weeknd plan to only invite family and a few close friends,"" the source shared. ""Selena's cousin Priscilla DeLeon will be the maid of honor and her little sister, Gracie Teefey, will be a flower girl. It's going to be very small.""

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have both been involved in highly publicized relationships in the past, and their own relationship is no different. After going public in January, the couple was seen spending time together in Los Angeles with French Montana and Jaden Smith, and a short time later, it was off to Italy where they were seen sightseeing in Venice and Florence.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd also spent time in Europe in late February and early March as The Weeknd's tour stopped in several cities, including Amsterdam and Paris, and they later traveled to Toronto before their arrival in Argentina days ago.

Although Selena Gomez and The Weeknd haven't confirmed an engagement or plans to wed, a second source recently spoke out about their relationship and revealed that they are quite serious about their future.

""It's serious, very serious,"" an insider told Hollywood Life. ""The Weeknd has already told [Selena Gomez] that he loves her and vice versa. He speaks a couple of languages and has made sure to confess his love in English, French, Spanish and Amharic.""

""Whenever they travel to a new country, he tells her he loves her in that language,"" the source continued. ""He doesn't speak Portuguese, but learned how to say I love you [in the language]. Selena of course loves how romantic he is and melts every time he says those three little words, or two, depending on the language.""

Prior to her relationship with The Weeknd, Selena Gomez was involved in an on-and-off relationship with Justin Bieber, and when the ""Cold Water"" singer discovered news of the relationship, he wasn't happy. As for The Weeknd, he previously dated model Bella Hadid.

2472,"Sarah Jessica Parker Inherits Vogue Magazine Control From Anna Wintour? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

There's only one Anna Wintour, but there's only so long that she can run Vogue. Anna's now 64 years old, and while she's still got plenty of years to keep running Vogue, her reign isn't going to last forever. Eventually, she will have to find a successor, and according to a report from Radar Online, that successor will be Sarah Jessica Parker.

Now, before you laugh yourself to sleep, listen to Radar's reasoning. Sarah and Anna are friends, and have been friends for a very long time, thanks to the long running popularity of Sex and the City. Vogue owes a huge debt to the show for putting it on the map, especially since the magazine didn't use to be the household name it is now.

Anyway, Radar's source explains, ""Anna isÂ worrying colleagues who believe she has found her true successor in Sarah!Â It's a surprising idea, but one that is not entirely a joke. Anna thinks Sarah, a fashion icon onÂ Sex and the City, truly has what it takes to step into her shoes and take on a role atÂ VogueÂ one day.Â Although Wintour has made no announcements about when she might retire, her scheme to put Parker in theÂ VogueÂ pipeline has co-workers shaking in their own designer shoes.""

You know, the idea's not as far-fetched as it sounds. Sarah's very fashion savvy, and while she doesn't seem like she'd be able to run Vogue as well as Anna [who would?], she does have the contacts and image to keep the brand name strong.

What do you guys think? Is Anna Wintour grooming Sarah Jessica Parker to take over Vogue for her? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

An explosive new interview withÂ Matt LeBlanc'sÂ dad,Â Paul LeBlanc, reveals that the actress actually cheated on her then-husband with herÂ Friends co-star long before Brad met Angelina Jolie, 40,Â on the set ofÂ Mr. and Mrs. Smith!

""He had fun, that's for sure,"" Paul tellsÂ Star Magazine of his son's time onÂ Friends. ""He even had a relationship with one of the girls...Jen. They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt."" OH SNAP!

Don't forget, Jen and Matt's characters had a brief fling on the show at the end of Season 9 and beginning of Season 10, so the whole situation is like life imitating art! And consideringÂ Friends ended in 2004, and Brad and Angelina didn't get together until shortly after that, then, if what Paul's saying is true, it means Jen actually cheated first.

This shocking claim could totally change the way we think about the Brad/Jen/Angelina love triangle forever, because it would mean that theÂ Cake star is no longer an innocent victim. However, Paul also noted inÂ Star's interview that he had a falling out with Matt three years ago, and aren't on the best of terms. Do you trust his credibility? ""It is absolutely 100 percent false!"" Jen's rep tellsÂ HollywoodLife.com. ""Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.""

Either way, everyone in this whole situation has CLEARLY moved on from whatever happened ten years ago. To everyone's surprise, Brad and Angelina's relationship stayed strong - they have six kids together and were married in Aug. 2014. Meanwhile, Jen has been engaged toÂ Justin Theroux since Aug. 2012.

Tell us,Â HollywoodLifers: Do you believe Jen cheated on Brad with Matt?

2626,"FKA Twigs Looks Miserable With Robert Pattinson At Cannes Film Festival | Celeb Dirty Laundry

FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson are reportedly going strong. The Twilight star and his fiancÃ©e attended the 2017 Cannes Film Festival this week. The couple didnât look as happy as they are reported to be. Itâs been months since fans have seen FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson together.

They keep their relationship low-key for the most part. Itâs probably because FKA Twig has to deal with the crazy Twilight fans bugging her on social media. She looked really sour when they went to the red-carpet premiere of Robert Pattinsonâs latest movie Good Time.

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were glowing on the red carpet. While Robert Pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there, his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event. FKA Twigs stood beside him in a busy Dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it.

The Daily Mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening. Robert Pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo.

He was later joined by co-stars Taliah Webster and Buddy Duress, writer and co-director Ben Safdie, and co-director Joshua Safdie. Robert Pattinson reportedly got engaged to FKA Twigs back in August 2015. The couple has kept their relationship out of the public eye as much as possible. Despite stepping out together at public events, they rarely speak out about their relationship. Though FKA Twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is â100 percent worth it.â

She told The Observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet. She only attends these events to support âthe man that I love.â She also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet. FKA Twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing. But, that doesnât stop her from loving and supporting Robert Pattinson.

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were all smiles when they celebrated his 31st birthday earlier this month in Culver City, Los Angeles. The actor beamed and even displayed PDA with FKA as they joined friends at an intimate party at Akasha restaurant. However, FKA Twigs seemed engaged with her phone every time Robert Pattinson was talking about something. The couple were later seen hugging and kissing each other outside the venue.

2495,"Taylor Swift: The Real Reason She Gave Selena Gomez The Challenge

Now we know one of theÂ reasons why Taylor Swift, 24, nominated Selena Gomez, 22, for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge on Aug. 16. A source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Taylor suggested Selena to take the icy plunge to see if she'd ""really listen"" to Taylor this time (since she doesn't about Justin Bieber, 20) and actually do it.

We've learned EXCLUSIVELY that Taylor believes Selena never listens to her and she nominated Selena for the challenge to see if she'd really accept.

""This is actually a test for Selena, since she doesn't listen to Taylor ever when it comes to advice she wants to see if she'll actually listen to her and do the ALS challenge,"" a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

Selena recently got back together with her on-again-off-again beau Justin, and Taylor's not exactly his biggest fan. She was so ""proud"" of Selena for dumping Justin, but Selena couldn't resist reuniting with Justin after he agreed to go to ""spiritual counseling together.""Â We previously reported that Taylor was ""sick of Selena telling her one thing and then going back to Justin.""

Selena did accept the challenge and thanked Taylor, or ""T-Swizzy,"" for the nomination. Selena posted the video of her getting soaked with icy cold water a few hours after Taylor completed the challenge with her friendÂ Jamie King, 35. Selena said she was also going to donate money and decided to nominateÂ Â Cara Delevingne, 22, Suki Waterhouse, 22, and James Franco, 36! Justin also took part in the icy challenge.

We're just glad to see Taylor, Selena and Justin all become a part of the fight to raise awareness for ALS. The more support the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge gets the better.

Despite Taylor's advice and Justin's partying ways, Selena is back together with Justin. Justin is on ""cloud nine"" since reuniting and a source revealed that he told her that she was ""his soulmate and couldn't live without her."" So sweet!

The two were spotted out together on a lovely day in California on Aug. 16. Justin was goofing around and Selena was seen laughing in the video! Later on in the day, Justin posted another video rapping a love song likely to Selena!

What do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Do you think Taylor used the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge to see if Selena would finally listen to her? Let us know!

2492,"Claims Anne Hathaway made 'diva' demands at charity event

ANNE Hathaway has been accused of acting like a diva and submitting a long list of demands before a cancer charity event in Santa Monica earlier this month.

The Les Miserables star allegedly submitted a long list of demands before agreeing to attend the Pink Party Gala in Santa Monica on October 19.

A source told In Touch magazine that the Oscar-winner's team were ""really concerned"" she would be bombarded by fans for photos and autographs at the event, and an email was sent to staff with a series of strict guidelines.

The insider added: ""Everyone was asked not to talk to her.""

The email, obtained by gossip website RadarOnline.com, also noted that other stars, who attended made no such demands.

The staff email stated: ""I know in the past our hosts have mingled in the party, but each person is different. We are trying to respect her space.""

A source also claimed that even though staff adhered to Anne's list of demands, the actress was very unfriendly.

The source said: ""She was so rude and acted like a b***h to a few people she did speak to. She just sat there rolling her eyes all night.""

Anne, 30, also attended the Victory Fund Champagne Brunch in Beverly Hills with her husband, Adam Shulman, on October 20, where she broke down in tears as she took to the stage to introduce cancer specialist Dr. Beth Karlan, who recently helped her friend beat the disease.

2462,"Jennifer Aniston's Diva Set Behavior - Won't Eat Lunch With The Cast, Luxury SUV And Private Trailer Miles Away!

Jennifer Aniston is an A-list movie star and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that's exactly what she acts like on set.

While in Connecticut filming the Untitled Elmore Leonard Project with other famous faces like Isla Fisher, Tim Robbins and Will Forte, a source close to the set says the former Friends actress doesn't socialize with any of the cast or crew and purposely keeps herself removed as much as possible.

""Every day at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together for well over an hour,"" the insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com.

""But the only person who doesn't eat with everyone else is Jen. She quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves.""

The source also claims Jen, 44, has fancier transportation than everyone else - as well as a trailer that is much farther away from the set than anybody else's.

""All the actors ride in normal production vans when they head to lunch, but Jen has her own luxury SUV,"" the source said.

""And not only is Jen's private trailer miles away from the set, but she heads all the way back there each day to eat her lunch away from everyone else.""

The source concluded by telling RadarOnline.com that Jen isn't outwardly rude to anyone on set, but that she just acts like a diva and it's off-putting to those around her.

""Her behavior is a clear indicator to everyone that she's not approachable,"" the source said.

""And it's just unnecessary. There's no reason why she has to act any better than anyone else on that movie set.""

2452,"Has Tom Hiddleston's 'Embarrassing' Romance With Taylor Swift Cost Him a Job?

Yikes, Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift's romance (showmance?) really isn't having the effect that their PR teams had hoped for, with Tom reportedly losing a huge contract due to the ""embarrassing"" display.

Last month it was reported that fashion giant Armani wasÂ considering using Tom as itsÂ new face, replacing Taylor's ex, Calvin Harris. (Interesting!)

However, it seems the Italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to Hiddleston's recent publicity-hungry antics with his new girlfriend.

Executives apparently fear that they will be seen as ""cashing in"" on the drama, something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from.

A source shared: ""Tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from Calvin.""

""Obviously with Tom now being Taylor's other half and the Calvin past deal, it would generate huge media coverage and headlines.

""But Armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better. Armani would hate to be seen as getting PR for their brand by riding on Taylor Swift's coattails, so Tom will not get the job.""

The insider continued: ""While Tom is without doubt one of the sexiest actors of his generation, he may not be the right fit this time.

""The brand is looking at attracting 30-somethings and under, so Tom may be a little too old."" Ouch.

Tom hit the headlines when he was conveniently photographed embracing Taylor on an isolated beach less than three weeks after she had split from her long-term boyfriend, Calvin.

The pair has embarked on a eyebrow-raising display of love across the globe, with Taylor even meeting Tom's mother in front of the waiting photographers after just nine days of dating.

Tom was relentlessly mocked after donning an ""I [heart] Taylor Swift"" tank top during Fourth of July celebrations and wondered if that might have a negative impact on his career (while others wondered if it was just a joke).

If Armani is indeed shying away from the star, that negative impact might be painfully real.

Harry Styles' new music isn't for everyone, not even his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne.

Cheryl Cole's beau stopped by Music Choice to chat about a range of topics but things got a little dicey when he was asked about Niall Horan's new single ""Slow Hands"" and Harry's ""Sign of the Times.""

Liam called Niall's track ""great"" and ""cool"" but boy did he not mince words when it came to his review of Harry's debut single as a solo artist.

""I'll be honest with you, it's not my sort of music,"" he shared. ""It's not something I'd listen to, but I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That's the way I'd put it best, I think."" You think?

""I think that the funny thing is, [Harry] would say the same thing about me because he doesn't really listen to hip-hop music, whereas it's like my song's more âRack City' and his song is more of a different era to something I'd listen to, I guess.""

Fair enough, Liam, and thank you for the clarification.
Just a few days ago, while promoting ""Sign of the Times,"" Harry explained to USA Today that writing his new album was ""like therapy.""

""I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things.""

Well, it looks like Harry and his legions of fans are happy with his new music regardless of what any of his former bandmates think!

2627,"Kendall Jenner: Why Sheâs Quitting âKUWTKâ But Remains Proud Of Kylieâs Spin-off Show

Kendall Jenner continues to distance herself from the reality show platform that made her family a household name, with sources stressing that the model wants to have a legitimate career.

Kendall Jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years, and as her brand continues to skyrocket, so are her annual earnings through endorsements, sponsorship deals, and modeling contracts.

Seeing how well things have been going with her career, Kendall Jenner sees no reason why she should remain on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Sheâs grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that sheâs working harder than ever before, she doesnât even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore.

From Kendall Jennerâs point of view, the 21-year-old wants to build a brand thatâs mainly focused on her modeling career. Sources say that by being on reality TV, Kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry.

Sheâs worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than Kim Kardashianâs little sister, and while itâs paid off for her, for the most part, Kendall Jenner canât stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world.

Sharing everything about her life, including who sheâs dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. To eventually become as famous and successful as Naomi Campbell or Kate Moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her.

âKendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylieâs new show, but only when sheâs in town and around â she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,â an insider tells Hollywood Life.

For now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on KUWTK, along with her sisterâs forthcoming reality show, Life of Kylie. But her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that itâs no longer where her mind is at.

âKendallâs modeling career is going really amazing, and sheâs worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like sheâs finally getting there and that sheâs now being booked because sheâs Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderenceâand itâs not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.â

Last month, the E! network confirmed that Kylie Jenner had landed her own spin-off titled Life of Kylie, Variety reports, which is expected to premiere in July.

The series will follow Kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire thatâs focused on beauty and cosmetics.

Kylie Cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while Kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, Kendallâs little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with Tyga.

Anything that could potentially make Kendall Jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if thereâs any sort of drama or tension on Kylieâs show, Kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesnât want to be seen in that light.

Do you think itâs a wise move for Kendall Jenner to ditch KUWTK in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?

2598,"O.J. Simpson will agree to Khloe Kardashian paternity test if she visits him in prison, former guard says

O.J. Simpson would reportedly take a paternity test to see if Khloe Kardashian is his daughter, but there's one catch: The reality star would need to visit him in prison.

The former football star, a close friend of late lawyer Robert Kardashian, will consent to a mouth swab but wants the ""Kocktails with Khloe"" starlet to ""show him a little respect"" and stop by the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, according to the Daily Mail Online.

The website cites Jeffrey Felix, a former Lovelock prison guard who claims the facility has given permission for the test, as its source. Felix also penned a book about Simpson called ""Guarding the Juice.""

""He wants to talk to her about some other things too, but more importantly like her he wants to know if she is his daughter,"" Felix said.

In the new documentary ""The Man Who Saved O.J. Simpson,"" Felix claimed the 31-year-old Kardashian had begged Simpson to put the paternity question to rest with a test.

Kardashian is the third of four children born to Robert Kardashian, who died of esophageal cancer in 2003, and Kris Jenner, who divorced him in 1991.

The reality star set off ceaseless rumors after speculating on a 2009 episode of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" that she might be adopted â and even swabbed her mom's mouth for a DNA test.

They continued to fend off gossip over Kardashian's paternity, particularly after Robert Kardashian's ex-wives Jan Ashley and Ellen Kardashian, who he married after divorcing Jenner, suggested in a 2012 Star Magazine story that she wasn't a member of the famous family.

Khloe Kardashian got first taste of racism during O.J. trial
""The audacity you have to mention my father's name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low,"" Kardashian, then married to Lamar Odom, tweeted at the time. ""YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).""

Jenner later chimed in during a ""Good Morning America"" interview, calling the theory ""crap"" and telling its promoters to ""get a life.""

""I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everythingâs good. Weâre all good,"" the momager said.

The ex-NFL star was famously acquitted of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in the 1995 ""Trial of the Century,"" during which Robert Kardashian served as a member of Simpson's legal dream team.

Jenner, who has admitted she wasnât faithful to the trial lawyer during their marriage, was a close friend of Brown Simpson.

Be honest. Itâs OK.â

As the small crowd of ticket winners began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced, âI can answer for yâall because I am free. Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.â

The 99 Problems rapper also hinted at his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling audiences to ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them. Instead of respecting the rules, Jay-Z instructed his audience to âDo what thou wiltâ.

It has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley, the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema.

The religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed; âDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Lawâ. This statement indicates that adherents, who are known as Thelemites, should seek out and follow their own true path in life, known as their True Will.

Jay-Zâs Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper, he reinvented his image as a dark lord, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game.

Since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image, however the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans suggests he is far from a reformed character, and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.

The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.

2619,"Kourtney Kardashian Neglecting Her Children To Party In Cannes? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Is Kourtney Kardashian neglecting her children to party in Cannes? Thatâs what a lot of fans canât help but wonder as Kris Jenner was spotted taking care of her children, Mason and Penelope Disick near her family home in Calabasas, California on Wednesday, May 24. Kris took her grandchildren to run errands with her while Kourtney was frolicking with her new boy toy Younes Bendjima.

Eyewitnesses say that Kris took Mason and Penelope along with Kim Kardashianâs daughter North West out for frozen yogurt. Sheâs babysitting her grandchildren while Kourtney and Scott are partying thousands of miles away in Cannes.

A lot of fans canât help but wonder why Kourtney would still be in Cannes knowing that Scott is there with his new girlfriend Bella Thorne. Apparently, both parents are trying to compete with each other for paparazzi and media attention while their children are back at home.

Sure, Kourtney Kardashian loves her children and puts them first in her life â sheâs proven it plenty of times in the past. But is her new romance with Younes Bendjima getting in the way of her parental responsibilities? That might be the case, especially since a lot of people are pointing out that both Kourtney and Scott are acting like children themselves.

Kourtney has spent the last week showing off her bikini body and making out with Younes in the South of France. Taking a page out of her book, Scott is now doing the same by partying with Bella. He was even spotted getting very up close and personal with her at their hotel pool in Cannes. Clearly, Scott is trying to make a point by cuddling and making out with the former Disney star in the same town as his ex and baby mama.

So far Kourtney has not made any comments about her new relationship with Younes Bendjima. But if thereâs one thing for certain, itâs that she doesnât plan on getting back with Scott Disick anytime soon.

That chapter is closed, done and in the past. Still, many critics canât help but wonder if Kourtney might be flaunting her relationship with Younes to make Scott jealous. After all, Scott did it to her several times in the past.

Either way, it doesnât look like Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disickâs drama is going to end anytime soon. In the meantime, donât forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news on Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick.

2447,"Tyga To Reveal The Ugly Truth About Kylie Jenner And Kardashians In New Tell-All Book, Insiders Say

Tyga and Kylie Jenner have made it to Splitsville, according to E! News, and it looks like things could get pretty ugly in the near future. Although the relationship is reportedly over, it doesn't look like the two have ended on amicable terms, and things are only beginning to heat up. According to Perez Hilton, Tyga is reportedly planning to release a tell-all book in the wake of his big break-up with Kylie. Insiders close to the ""Make It Nasty"" rapper have dropped a few details about the rumored upcoming book.

But how would the Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch, Kris Jenner, feel about Tyga releasing a shocking tell-all book about Kylie and the Kardashian family? In most cases, close friends of the Kardashian family are locked into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit them from speaking publicly about the family. But apparently, Tyga never signed any form of agreement which would allow him to speak publicly if he desires. A family insider recently shared details about the alleged book.

Although Tyga and Kylie Jenner initially tried desperately to conceal their relationship because of Kylie's age, it's no secret he's been in her life for quite some time. Because of that, he's also seen a lot, including how she's evolved over the years. It's quite obvious Kylie's had a number of cosmetic surgeries, but now Tyga reportedly plans to reveal just how many enhancements she's actually had. The insider even insists Tyga was there for many of the surgeries she had.

However, that's not all. The insider also claims Tyga has a staggering amount of incriminating details about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for his tell-all book. Since Tyga and Kanye have collaborated on records, he's spent lots of time with the Yeezus rapper and his famous wife. But apparently, all of his interactions with the couple haven't been pleasant. In fact, the insider claims Tyga has enough dirt on the couple to write more than one book. For months now, several rumors have circulated about the famous couple's marital problems, but of course, the rumors have not been confirmed.

Reports about Tyga's tell-all book come shortly after their epic break-up on the rapper's 26th birthday. According to People magazine, Kylie Jenner is absolutely furious about her ex-boyfriend's alleged cheating. An insider close to the 18-year-old reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heart-wrenching breakup.

Although the Kardashian women have a history of on-again, off-again relationships, it looks like this may definitely be the end for Tyga and Kylie Jenner.

Do you think Tyga and Kylie Jenner are completely done? If Tyga released a tell-all book, would you read it? Share your thoughts.

2618,"Kirsten Dunst suddenly breaks down in tears at Cannes Film Festival

She gained global recognition for her role inÂ Interview With The Vampire at the tender age of 12, so she is no stranger to commanding attention on the red carpet.

But new shots have emerged of Kirsten Dunst suddenly breaking down in tears as she attended The Beguiled premiere during the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival in the South of France on Wednesday.

Making a dramatic red carpet appearance, the accomplished Â actress, 35, was seen crying as she stepped out in a fairytale plunging ballgown to promote the film.

In unexpected scenes, Kirsten found herself overwhelmed with emotion, catching the attention of onlookers as she wiped away the tears.

Quick to join her wereÂ co-star Elle Fanning, dressed in strapless lilac gown, and the director of the filmÂ Sofia Coppola, dressed in a black padded jacket.

The smiling reaction from the duo suggested the Golden Globe nominee was tears of happiness.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Kirsten Dunst for comment.

In spite of it being an emotional night, Kirsten looked beautiful in a full-length prom queen-style gown.

The Virgin Suicides starlet pinned her golden locks back, letting only a few wisps fall forward to frame her face.

But Kirsten's stunning appearance was not marred by her tears as her slick of scarlet lipstick and eyeliner remained perfectly in place.

Touched by the night's emotions, she clasped her hand to her chest as she appeared to confide in her co-star Colin Farrell.

The actress did not publicly share the reason to why she suddenly burst into tears.

Later she was seen laughing and smiling with pals after an unexpectedly eventful red carpet appearance.

Kirsten was promoting her movie, The Beguiled, which tells the story of an injured solider who seeks shelter in an all girls' boarding school.

As the drama unfolds and the serviceman (Colin Farrell) tries to win the hearts of the women who nurse him.

Dangerous rivalries begin to form between the women (played by Kirsten, Elle Fanning and Nicole Kidman) as a result of sexual temptation.

During filming for a previous movie, the director had asked Kirsten to lose weight but she had refused.

Recalling the incident, she told Variety: 'Iâm eating fried chicken and McDonaldâs before work. So Iâm like, 'We have no options!

'Iâm sorry I canât lose weight for this role.''

'Itâs so much harder when youâre 35 and hate working out.'Â

In today's installment of ""Why Is This Happening?"" a reboot for American Idol is reportedly already on the table-and Kanye West is a sought-after potential judge.

Although the famed singing competition ran for an impressive 15 seasons and ended less than a year ago (the series finale aired on April 7, 2016), RadarOnline.com reports that NBC is pursuing the Chicago rapper to join the judging panel for a revival of the show, thanks to former host and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer, Ryan Seacrest.

""Ryan Seacrest has put his name forward during his negotiations to come back as host and NBC are salivating over it,"" an anonymous source told the site. Apparently, West is at ""the very top of the wish list"" above Simon Cowell, and he's already started ""grilling"" Jennifer Lopez, who became an Idol judge in 2010, about the position.

""It's not an easy gig, but the offer he's got is proving to be very hard to refuse,"" the source added.

If he joins, this wouldn't be his first time making an appearance on the show. He actually made a cameo last season during the open call when he did a mock audition for the series. Kim Kardashian was there proudly supporting him, too.

Sure, Kanye judging on Idol would make for interesting TV, but the idea of rebooting a long-running show less than a year after it ended? It's gonna be a no from me, dawg.

""He used to be the life of the party. Now he won't let any woman near him,"" the source further claimed.

Gossip Cop looked over the matter and busted the website for making up false news about the Inception actor as some of the actors' close pals called the magazine's report as 'nonsense.'

Given that, the actor was recently spotted attending Drake's birthday party in Los Angeles with his pals Jamie Foxx and Tobey Maguire.

Besides that, last week he was also joined by Robert Pattinson and The Weeknd for his own birthday party at The Highlight Room in LA. A few weeks ago, he was spotted hanging out with a bunch of friends in New York City as well.

Thus, it is clear that the star is neither antisocial nor developing major trust issues. Earlier the website has also busted a lot of fake reports about the actor's personal life too.

Pregnant Kylie Jenner Is 'Very Self-Conscious' About Her Changing Body, Says Source
Since Kylie Jennerâs pregnancy was confirmed nearly two months ago, the social media mogul has largely remained out of the spotlight â and she intends to stay that way, at least for now.

âKylie is only trusting her closest friends and her sisters right now. She wants to reveal things on her own terms but sheâs of course having fun teasing everyone. She knows all the attention is on her and her baby bump, but she wonât share until she wants to,â a source close to the Kylie Cosmetics founder tells PEOPLE.

In September, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the 20-year-old reality star is due in February with her first child â a baby girl â with rapper Travis Scott, whom she has been dating sinceÂ earlier this year afterÂ splitting from herÂ on-again, off-again boyfriendÂ TygaÂ in April.

âTravis is so excited about the baby. Theyâre both trying to enjoy this time for themselves and keep it private as long as they can. They know itâs going to be a frenzy when they do come out,â an insider close to the 25-year-old rapper tells PEOPLE.

âTravis is crazy about Kylie and he feels so lucky to have her and the baby,â adds the insider. âThe family has been welcoming â they know how important it is to Kylie that everyone gets along.â

Although the couple is elated about becoming parents, the expectant Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is feeling self-conscious about her figure.

âHer body is changing and sheâs very self-conscious about it,â says the source. âSheâs always been insecure that sheâs not as curvy or pretty as her sisters.â

Despite having feelings of insecurity as a result of her changing shape, the Lip Kit business mogul has her loving and supportive boyfriend by her side.

âKylie and Travis are very happy together,â the source shares. âThey spend time away from the spotlight and heâs been supportive.â

The reality starâs baby wonât be the only new member joining the famous KarJenner brood: Jennerâs older sister Kim Kardashian West is expecting her third child (via surrogate) with husband Kanye West.

Meanwhile, it was a local French publication La Rep des Pyrenees that revealed the news that Kate & William were holidaying in France. The couple was on a private jet and was moved to two waiting Range Rovers, after touching down.

The cars were blacked out to avoid the paparazzi. The Pau-Pyrenees airport where the couple touched down declined to comment on the royal visit.

The couple along with their kids Prince George and Princess Charlotte were visiting the region to meet friends and relation, Daily Mail reports. There were also royal protection officers as well as officers from Scotland Yard.

So it looks like Kate Middleton & Prince William were tired of their royal duties and needed a break and hence the break. As they mend their crumbling relationship, Kate and WilliamÂ areÂ reportedly trying toÂ have Baby No 3.

2568,"Is the Queen preparing abdicate?

His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI announced it through the Vatican, to shock and surprise.

A poised Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to YouTube, and King Juan Carlos of Spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill.

Queen Elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do.

Abdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of Royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle Edward VIII quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.

And there is no indication that that will ever change.

Yet with the Queen now into her 92nd year, and with the hard-working Duke of Edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96, plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see Charles appointed King in all but name.

Palace sources have indicated that the Queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation called the Regency Act to come into force â granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives.

I have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. They have all confirmed that a Regency with Charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility.

One senior former member of the Royal Household said: âOut of the profound respect the Queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, Her Majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. She is dutiful to her core.

âHer Majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the Crown is seamless.

âI understand the Queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at 95, she will seriously consider passing the reign to Charles.â

Clarence House â the household of Prince Charles â is making no comment about Plan Regency, as it has been called. However, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court.

But Palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be âup to speedâ on the 1937 Regency Act, which grants power to the heir apparent âin the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the Royal functions in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign in certain other eventsâ.

The development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court â a series of senior staff changes and departures at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, home to the young Royals.

The Queenâs Private Secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, 55, resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a âwholesale regime changeâ â as revealed in The Mail on Sunday.

His shrewd deputy â former banker, political adviser and television executive Edward Young, 50 â will replace Sir Christopher after a suitable handover period.

I understand that a number of other high-profile figures â many loyal to Sir Christopher â are poised to leave the Royal Households at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace after his unexpected exit.

They include Assistant Private Secretary Samantha Cohen, the capable former Press Secretary and Sir Christopherâs number three in the private office. Ms Cohen, who is Australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the Queen.

Falklands and Afghanistan veteran, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Master of the Queenâs Household, is also said to be weighing up his position. Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when Prince Philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, Sir Michael Stevens.

At Kensington Palace, the Duchess of Cambridge has hired a new Private Secretary, Catherine Quinn, who is head of the University of Oxfordâs Said Business School. It is understood she will take up her new role in October.

Prince Williamâs Private Secretary, former Ministry of Defence communications expert Miguel Head, and Prince Harryâs Private Secretary, former Blues and Royals Captain Ed Lane Fox, 40, are also said to be considering their options.

Perhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at Clarence House, home to Prince Charles.

Of course, the transition to a world in which significantly more Royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. Next month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working Royals, and Prince Harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmotherâs side.

âAs ever, the Queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,â said the former member of the Royal Household. âOf course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.â

That is not in doubt. On her 21st birthday in 1947 the then Princess Elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. Speaking from Cape Town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous.

âI can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening,â she said. âI should like to make that dedication now. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.â

It was a conviction that she confirmed in her Coronation Oath on June 2, 1953.

While it may be acceptable for Queen Beatrix and King Juan Carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, Palace aides still believe the âA wordâ is not part of Her Majestyâs vocabulary.

There is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the Queen, at 91, is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands â one who is now without the company of Prince Philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year.

The monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve.

Charles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her Diamond Jubilee year to Australia and New Zealand.

Earlier this year he went in her place to Canada to mark the nationâs 150th anniversary. On a tour of the Persian Gulf, he represented the Crown and was treated like a king with other Royals bowing to him.

More will no doubt come as the Queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties.

A Regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover â and, indeed, the Act was considered in more recent times when the Queen first acceded to the throne.

Documents show that following the Coronation of 1953, the young Elizabeth II intervened to ensure that Prince Philip â and not her sister Princess Margaret â would take over as Regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before Charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. This was not, of course, required.

Times have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today?

Certainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly.

To safeguard against a coup, a Regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the Sovereignâs consort, in this case the Duke of Edinburgh; the Lord Chancellor, David Lidington; the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow; the Lord Chief Justice, the incoming Sir Ian Burnett; and Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton.

Clarence House and Buckingham Palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. But as one insider told me: âWe are in uncharted territory right now â a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.â

2537,"What Taylor Swift's New Make-Under Really Means

Unless you've been living on a tropical island without Wi-Fi, you probably know (at least) a little about the drama that's been following Taylor Swift around for the past year or so. There's a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, Reputation, addresses her side of the story.

From her tumultuous relationship with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don't have to surf for long to get caught up. But her latest single, ""Call It What You Want,"" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album â and a new beauty look to match.

From what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. Whether she's admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there's certainly something different here.

The private videos-turned-music video â at least that's what it looks like to us â appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new Taylor. (She did say the ""old Taylor"" was dead, if you recall.) Naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. That is: No red lipstick in sight, no ""Shake It Off"" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. According to Twitter, this might be the real image Swift is ready to bring back.

Whether you think this is Swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it's a clever move for redemption, it's hard to deny the pattern we've seen in Hollywood before. Most recently, Miley Cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. Alongside her new album Younger Now, Cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her ""Malibu"" music video where her naked face took center stage.

Only time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.

2617,"Photos Of Angelina Jolie In A Wedding Dress Claim To Prove Quickie Marriage To Rando Brit After Brad Pitt Divorce

Photos of Angelinaâs Jolieâs wedding dress have been making the rounds on the celebrity rumors circuit these past few months after an In Touch front page cover claimed Angie got married to a British man just eight months after the split with Brad Pitt. This would be Angelinaâs fourth marriage if the tabloidâs article was true, but based upon other reports, it seems safe to say this surprise wedding is likely fake news.

Back in April, In Touch ran a cover story declaring, âAngelinaâs Shocking Surprise: Wedding In Cambodia! Marriage No. 4 Just 8 Months After Split With Brad.â The tabloid was running with the idea that Angelina Jolieâs divorce from Brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a âwealthy, 40-something Brit.â Angelinaâs dating of this âphilanthropist business manâ was supposedly being âshieldedâ from the public âby her closest friends.â Worse, Angelinaâs children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned.

âA quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback [to Brad Pitt],â claimed an unnamed âfamily friendâ who is the supposed source for In Touch.

While Angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are Angelina and Bradâs six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. In April, Gossip Cop pointed out that âthis tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readersâ and an unnamed source of their own claimed that Angieâs 2017 wedding rumors are âbeyond ridiculous.â

Fast forward in time and In Touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. Now, they are running a cover allegedly showing Angelina Jolieâs wedding in Cambodia. The front cover and the way it features Angelinaâs wedding dress are designed to give the impression that Angie has already been married. But if you break open the tabloid, In Touch is claiming Angelina is still planning a future 2017 wedding in Battambang, Cambodia.

The latest edition is still alleging that Jolie has âquietly fallen for a wealthy 40-something British philanthropist and businessman, and sheâs eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from Brad is finalized.â The same âfamily friendâ is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie starâs plans for a small wedding that celebrates the Cambodian culture. Pitt is supposedly not âstanding in her way anymore.â The funny part is that no one knows the name of Angelinaâs dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail.

In this case, Gossip Cop claims the âtabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazineâs dreadful reporting.â The real problem is that itâs not merely bad information from an unknown source, Gossip Cop alleges that In Touch âhas simply been making it all upâ by generating fake news.

What is the truth? After all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Ryan Gosling, and Eva Mendes. In the end, In Touch and its secret âfamily friendâ stand alone in reporting Angelina Jolieâs wedding plans, while Gossip Cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has âcreated a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.â It seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked. What do you think?

2520,"Has Khloe Kardashian had fillers?

She emphatically denied that she had any work done on her face to her own sisters on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, but now the truth is out.

Khloe Kardashian has admitted that she got facial fillers on the latest episode of her chat show Kocktails With Khloe, but it didnât work out how she wanted.

The 31-year-old reality star, who has overhauled her image since her split from former NBA star Lamar Odom, revealed that she had a few bits done but didnât like the results.

âMy face was f****d!â she was heard telling her guests on the show.

Talking to plastic surgeon Dr Terry Dubrow, of the TV show Botched on her TV show, Khloe revealed how the look just didnât work for her and she returned to get the filler âdissolvedâ.

âIt did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there - I went to have it all dissolved like three times,â she said.

Khloe insisted that the first time she had the work done was before Lamarâs âaccidentâ in October last year, when he was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel after a wild weekend.

âI did it and then Lamar's accident happened,â Khloe explained, claiming that the result was affected by the athleteâs collapse.

âI was so stressed out the doctor was like, âI think it's just too much was happening to your real emotionsâ,â she said.

Raging about the look, Khloe continued: âMy face was so f***ed I had to go and get this whole thing dissolved.

âIt was a bummer and now I'm afraid to do it again. And I'm almost like, I swear things are still in my face.â

Khloe previously denied having any fillers, and was seen in the season finale of the familyâs reality show telling her own sisters â Kim and Kourtney â that she had not received any treatment when quizzed about her changing look.

In scenes that aired in January, following Krisâ 60 Great Gatsby-themed birthday bash in November, Kim is heard speaking to Khloe on the phone.

âKhloe, I was gonna call you and talk to you last night about this,' Kim said. âYour whole face has changed. Did you do any filler?â

Khloe Kardashian kept her look pale and interesting as she stepped out in LA.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star showcased her enviable curves as she enjoyed an outing with mum Kris Jenner.

Khloe, 31, bared her bra in a see-through white tank top which she teamed with a pair of form-fitting white jeans.

She completed her look with a pair of aviator sunglasses and high-heeled beige suede shoes.

Momager Kris, 60, kept her look simple in a black blazer, jeans and trainers and her toyboy boyfriend Corey Gamble, 35, looked laid-back in a grey tracksuit.

Khloe stepped out after returning from a boozy trip to Napa Valley with her mum and sister Kourtney.

The trio shared hilarious videos of their tipsy exploits on Snapchat as they sampled the alcohol.

From a conversation about ""squirting"", to some sexy dancing from Khloe, and then THAT chant/rap from Kris - we saw quite the show from the family members.

In one video Kris was seen looking ahead as she continuously chanted: ""Oh walkie talkie, Oh wa, oh wa, oh walkie talkie.""

Kourtney shared a snap revealing half drunk glasses of wine with the caption: ""Hungover wine tasting.""

We bet they had sore heads the next day.

At one point, Kris appeared unable to pronounce the word ""Kindle,"" as Khloe corrected her, saying, ""No, a Kendall is your daughter. Kindle.""

Later Khloe couldn't resist poking fun at her sister Kylie, as she used a face distortion app to make her lips huge - joking that it's the ""Kylie Jenner filter"".

Kylie has admitted to having temporary lip fillers, insisting it has helped her confidence.

The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.

Rupaul says he found DonaldÂ Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.

This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.

Many women have come forward over the last week to denounceÂ the abusiveÂ groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.

The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps's alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.

All theseÂ allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.

The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show ""Access Hollywood.""

The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.

He added: ""Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""

In Rupaul's case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.

Brad Pitt ""lunged"" at his son Maddox during a flight on a private jet as the teen tried to defend his mum Angelina Jolie, it has been claimed.

The actor - whose wife Angelina filed for divorce and ended their 12-year relationship following the reported incident - is accused of being ""wasted"" and ""screaming"" while in the air with his partner and two of their children.

Now, according to TMZ, it's claimed Brad began arguing with his wife mid-air, and when Maddox jumped up to defend her, he allegedly ""lunged"" at his son.

The site claims ""Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband"", but it's not clear what led to the alleged incident, or if it was even intentional.

But a source told Mirror Celebs: ""These claims are exaggerated and fabricated. It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.

""They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of disagreements. Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.""

Another source added that the FBI is investigating the claims as a jurisdictional issue due to the alleged incident taking place in the air.

The insider added Pitt - who is ""cooperating fully"" with authorities - denies being abusive and wants to do what is best for his children.

As the plane touched down, The Sun reports that the World War Z star allegedly continued his ""rant"" at the 15-year-old before then trying to leave the place in a fuel truck on the tarmac.

The Mirror understands the alleged incident was the tipping point for Jolie to call time on their 12-year relationship.

Kardashian, who has remained with the children at their 9,000-square-foot spread in L.A.'s Bel Air, ""is being very protective and doesn't want Kanye around the kids right now,"" explains the friend.



Still, the Selfish author hasn't entirely shut out West. Hours after the 21-time Grammy winner was released, he attended the balloon-filled ""low-key"" family party Kardashian held for Saint days before his December 5 birthday, says a West insider.

Kimye aired the footage of the engagement on Keeping Up With the Kardashians in a two part special, but they are insisting that Hurley's releasing of the video hit them in the wallet.

He will face off with the power couple in court on November 17, Judge Ruth Kwan ruled on Friday, unless they can reach a settlement before then.

Given Kardashian and West's aggressive stance so far, however, that seems unlikely.

On March 14, Kardashian and West filed a motion to quash Hurley's attempt to have the case dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that they ""generally object to the entirety"" of Hurley's argument and the judge ruled in their favor.

2479,"'It was a long time coming': Heidi Klum ends seven-year marriage over Seal's 'volcanic temper'

Seal and Heidi Klum insisted their split was 'amicable' yesterday despite reports that the supermodel could no longer put up with the Kiss from a Rose singer's volcanic temper.

In a formal statement, the superstar couple finally confirmed rumours swirling around for days that they were breaking up.

According to the US celebrity website TMZ, Klum, 38, demanded a divorce because she was worried about the effect Seal's was having on their children. 



The claim followed reports that she was also fed up with the 48-year-old British singer's 'hard partying.'

There was no suggestion of infidelity, but one source said: 'It was a long time in coming.' 



Heidi father Gunther Klum - who had the German model with wife Ema - today spoke out about the breakdown of the couple'sÂ  marriage.

He told US Weekly magazine: 'We are very sad.'

A statement released by the couple today read: 'While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.

'We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.

'This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.

'We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.'



at Seal's beachfront home in Mexico in 2005 , Seal and Klum kept their promise to renew their vows every year on theirÂ  anniversary with their close friends and family.

They have three children together â Henry, six, Johan, five, and Lou, two â as well as Miss Klum's daughter Leni, seven, from a previous relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.

And the tension in their relationship is believed to have started when the pair holidayed with their three children in Ibiza in August.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'They were always the couple everybody strived to be but lately it all started to change. Seal seems to have been partying a lot more often than usual.

'When they had their holiday in Ibiza last summer, Seal hit it hard, was out at clubs and with his friends a lot and Heidi was left with their kids trying to enjoy herself. The cracks were appearing and everybody was talking during that trip. He seemed off the rails.'

The insider added: 'They've spent a lot of time apart too on work assignments and that hasn't helped matters.

'Then when Seal came back to the UK to do promotional work for his next album, he seemed sleepy and not with it on shows like Loose Women, when he was very late for his appearance.'

And a source told The Sun today: 'The marriage ended months ago in reality. They rarely saw each other and it wouldn't be unusual for them to go months without spending any real quality time together. Ships that pass in the night would be an overstatement.'

German-born Heidi, 38, is reportedly expected to file papers at Los Angeles' County Superior Court this week citing 'irreconcilable differences'.

Happy: The couple were last seen together on December 26, with Heidi tweeting this picture of them on holiday in Aspen, Colorado

Happier times: Klum and the Crazy crooner share custody of their four children - Leni, 10, Henry, 8, Johan, 7, and Lou, 4 (not pictured)

Seal, 48 â real name Seal Henry Samuel â left a cryptic message posted on his Twitter page on Friday that read: 'The End.' 



The message was attached to a picture that appeared to show the star's forearm bearing an imprint of a set of wings â a possible reference to Miss Klum's role as a Victoria's Secret winged 'Angel' model.

The split paves the way for a multi-million-pound divorce battle between the golden couple. 



Heidi, one of the world's most in-demand models, is reported to have earned more than Â£12âmillion in the past year alone.

Seal, who is best known for his Kiss From A Rose single, has sold more than 20âmillion albums and won three Brit Awards and three Grammys in a career spanning 20 years. 



The couple own a home in Mexico and an Â£8.4âmillion mansion in Los Angeles. Yesterday there was no sign of them at the LA house, which is set in an exclusive gated community in Mandeville Canyon, in the Hollywood Hills.

On Wednesday, Seal was in London to pre-record a performance of his new single Backstabbers for Jonathan Ross's ITV chat show, which was broadcast on Saturday night.

Staying professional: Seal was in London last week to pre-record his performance on Jonathan Ross' show, which was broadcast on Saturday night Day job: Heidi has been known in recent years for presenting fashion-based reality show Project Runway Meanwhile, Miss Klum was alone as she attended the Golden Globes awards in Hollywood last Sunday.

 News of the split comes just weeks after the couple posed, apparently happily, for a photo on a skiing holiday in Colorado. On December 26 Miss Klum posted a picture on Twitter of the couple on the slopes in Aspen with the caption, 'Sun and Snow andÂ  @Seal'. Miss Klum divorced her first husband, stylist Ric Pipino after five years together in 2002 and met Seal a year later in 2003. 

 At the time she had just split fromÂ  Formula 1 billionaire Briatore.

Just last month, Lawrence, 26, was spotted making out with the 47-year-old Black Swan director in New York City.

But Aronofsky, who's dad to a son named Henry, was recently completely turned off by Lawrence's famously raunchy sense of humor.

""He finds her a little immature and was pretty horrified by her 'wet sponge' private parts comment to Vanity Fair,"" said the insider.

Lawrence confessed to the magazine that she suffers an irrational fear.

""If you've ever read the Kurt Vonnegut short story where everyone has to take these pills that make your private parts feel like wet sponges and then nobody can have sex and no one can procreate,"" she explained. ""And so by the time I'm older and I'm like, 'I think I want to be a mother,' they're like, 'You can't. Your private part feels like a sponge.'""

Hillary Clinton recently paid a visit to the Queen ... Bey, that is!

""Beyonce was filming a video and Hillary made a surprise visit to the set"" on Thursday, March 24, in L.A., a source exclusively reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.

The insider could not reveal if the Democratic front-runner, 68, scored an on-screen cameo, but a second insider confirms Beyonce, 34, is currently working on an album, complete with music videos. (The album is likely to drop in April.)

By the next morning, Clinton had returned to the campaign trail, setting her sights on the goal she laid out in December.



""I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer,"" she said when asked at an Iowa town hall if she'd rather be Beyonce or president.

No doubt securing a permanent spot in the hive, the presidential hopeful had high praise for the pop star at the event: ""You see her on TV, it's impressive; you see her in person, you're just stunned. Thinking like, 'How does she do that?' Really. I mean, she's singing, she's up and she's down. She's just amazing.""

The admiration is mutual. Last May, Beyonce attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser event in NYC. Although the mom of Blue Ivy, 4, with husband Jay Z supported Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races, now sheÂ wants her girl Hillary to run the world.

Report says that the 'How to Be a Latin Lover' actor is currently in talks to play the reality show star in a possible movie based on her new memoir 'The Secrets of My Life'.
Caitlyn Jenner new memoir ""The Secrets of My Life"" reportedly will be adapted into a movie, with ""How to Be a Latin Lover"" actor Rob Lowe reportedly in talks to play her. A source told OK! that the actor would be interested to portray the Olympian-turned-transgender reality show star. 

""Robâs been hunting for an awards-caliber movie part. This would be a game-changer for him,"" a source told the magazine. The insider went on saying that Caitlyn had sent Rob a copy of her book and that ""they've met up a few times to discuss it."" The source added, ""She thinks he's got what it takes to play both her and her former self, Bruce, and now Rob's throwing his weight behind the project as well."" 

However, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply ""not true."" A rep for Rob tells the site that ""he hasn't met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic."" Caitlyn simply said in an interview that Rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film, but the idea hasn't been brought into real life yet. As for the memoir itself, there hasn't been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie. 

Caitlyn's 320-page memoir ""The Secret of My Life"" was published last April and chronicled her life as well as revealed some intriguing truths about her past. One of them was the claim that her ex-wife Kris Jenner actually knew about her gender issue during their then-marriage. 

""I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her,"" wrote Caitlyn. ""This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues.

This is very exciting news for the Mom actress and her husband, Chris Pratt, 37, who have a 4-year-old son, Jack. The best part?

Anna and Chris have been open about their desire to have more children in the past, including their decision to wait after Jack was born nine weeks premature. On top of that, Anna has revealed that sheâs considered a âhigh-risk pregnancyâ, which could seriously complicate things. âI wish we didnât have this biological clock.

2435,"Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms

On March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers. 



Once the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS' helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper - and away from the public eye - Melania dropped the act. And Donald's hand. ""Melania,"" a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, ""does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.""

That includes the presiÂ­dent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who's currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC's Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. ""They have separate bedrooms,"" says another Trump insider. ""They never spend the night together - ever."" (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: ""It's very 'royal' of them!"") 



Upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, ""Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,"" explains the family source. ""She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him."" A rep for Melania denies the claims telling Us, ""It's unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed 'sources' that have provided fictional accounts.""



Since assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn't set foot in the nation's capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly. 



Melania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister's wife, around Palm Beach in February, but ""only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,"" according to the family source. ""She refused to do it in Washington.""

2424,"Kim Kardashian: Nude Cookbook on the Way?!?

Not everyone is a fan ofÂ Kim Kardashian and/or the books she pretends to write.

Just the other day, some 74-year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of Kim's selfie-based memoir.

But we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray one's sticky seed all over its page.

If you know what we mean.

According to one of the funniest Radar Online stories we've read in awhile, Kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook.

Yes, a nude cookbook. As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.

We challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.

A video report on Radar claims that ""Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn't have any,"" adding by way of explanation:

""The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.""

This may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:

You don't need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you're a bit embarrassed to admit it.

But the answer to question number-two is revealed below:

Before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe's ""Rude Food.""

In that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.

Via Amazon, this allowed him ""to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.""

An anonymous insider tells Radar thatÂ Kardashian is convinced ""her concept will succeed because she thinks she's in the best shape of her life after having two children.""

She does look pretty good at the moment, don't you think?

Last week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her ""generous cupcakes.""

By this, we assume the publication meant her ""very large breasts.""

For someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.

She could make the talk show rounds.

She could gain new social media followers.

She could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.

We really don't see any drawbacks.

Moreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?

Considering the following releases, all of which are 100% real, it may actually be the best.

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly gotten back in touch through texting, even though sources from both sides are falling over themselves to clarify that it's 'just texting' and not anything more serious.

Oh, Jen. She's probably so happy inside, even though she would never admit it for fear of coming across as petty. Think about it â this is the same man who humiliated her by dumping her for another woman, and now he's the single one while she's happily (or seemingly happily) married. AND he's texting her! It's all her dreams coming true.

Anyway, sources claim that Jennifer and Brad have been casually texting over the past few days, and Brad has been discussing how difficult the divorce has been for him. Apparently, Jennifer has been helping him through this, which is a little suspicious. Being magnanimous, fine, but offering support and advice to an ex-husband that you spent more than a decade getting over? Um... no.

It's been several months since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce and took their kids with her, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Brad Pitt has been having a tough time since then. He's withdrawn from the spotlight, and we probably wouldn't have seen or heard from him at all if it were not for the fact that he produced Moonlight, one of the most visible films on this year's awards circuit and the eventual winner of this year's Best Picture Oscar.

Regardless, for whatever reasons, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are back in touch â and how does Angelina Jolie feel about this? Well, apparently, not very happy. Again, not much of a surprise. Angelina may have been the one to call it quits, but that doesn't mean that she's over her ex-husband, the same way he's not over her.

She didn't leave because she fell out of love with him, she left because of his 'issues', whatever those issues were. And now, to hear that he's talking with his ex-wife, the woman that he left for her? Let's just say â if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie weren't already broken up, that might have done the trick.

There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.

The source said, ""Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn't ready for a serious relationship, but now she's showing Jake how much she's matured. She's excited to see where things go.""

In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.

An unidentified source told Star magazine that, ""He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor's new number. They've kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""

This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.

""This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex's and starts talking about how he's heard we're going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together - just, ugh, the worst!

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""

In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.

Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.

2429,"Taylor Swift 'files documents to launch streaming service'

Taylor Swift has reportedly filed documents to launch her own streaming service in the wake of her backlash against Apple Music and Spotify.

The Shake It Off hitmaker, who hit out at streaming services for offering her music for free in 2015, is said to have made moves to brand a website 'featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings'.

TMZ report that the website will be dubbed 'Swifties' and will launch a line of music products complete with guitars, picks, straps and drumsticks atop organising educational trips, online courses and retreats.

Taylor's now-famous feud with streaming services saw her revealÂ she will not allow her latest album on Apple Music to protest its 'shocking' lack of artist compensation during a free trial period.

The move by Taylor, who is one of the most outspoken critics of Spotify, delivered an early blow to Apple's bid to dominate the booming sector two years ago.

She said that the tech giant, which launched Apple Music in June 2015, will not pay for songs streamed during a free three-month trial period for new subscribers.

'I find it to be shocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company,' she wrote in a posting on Tumblr.

Taylor - whose '1989' was the top-selling US album in 2014 and remained high on the charts - insisted that she was speaking for all artists and not just herself.

'This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt.

'This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field...but will not get paid for a quarter of a year's worth of plays on his or her songs.

'These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much.'

'Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done,' she continued.

'I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.

'But I say to Apple with all due respect, it's not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Taylor for comment.

2518,"Kanye West Skipped Serena Williamsâ Wedding To Avoid âAwkwardâ Run In With Beyonce

While Kim Kardashian made it to Serena Williamsâ wedding, Kanye West was noticeably not her plus one. Weâve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with BeyoncÃ© at all costs.

Thereâs a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serenaâs close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didnât want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. âIt was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serenaâs wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kimâs friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that BeyoncÃ©, a close friend of Serenaâs, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,â a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.
âKanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with BeyoncÃ© and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serenaâs big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,â our source continues. Yeezy hasnât come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someoneâs wedding. See pics of guests at Serenaâs wedding, here.

Kim played it safe and made it a girlâs trip to Serenaâs big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloeâs BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. BeyoncÃ© also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and BeyoncÃ© have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serenaâs wedding, but were separated by Beyâs former Destinyâs Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.âs  fairytale wedding and not anyone elseâs drama.
HollywoodLifers, do you think it was wise of Kanye to skip a confrontation with BeyoncÃ© at Serenaâs wedding?

2620,"Iggy Azalea and Odell Beckham Jr.: Dating!

You might be surprised by the news that Odell Beckham Jr. and Iggy Azalea are dating, but if you stop and think about it for a moment, they actually make perfect sense as a couple.

For one thing, Odell is famous for his one-handed catch, and Iggy is a famous one-hit wonder.

Beckham is forever frustrating defensive backs with his incredible talent, while Azalea frustrates her peers by being an offensive hack with an appalling lack of talent.

The list goes on and on:

Odell is a wide receiver, and Iggy receives widespread criticism for being awful.

Beckham runs hot routes and catches passes, while Azalea received a pass for being a terrible rapper because she's hot.

You get the idea.

Anyway, according to Us Weekly, Beckham and Azalea have finally started admitting that they're a couple.

Rumors that Odell and Iggy are dating first started circulating back in May, but both parties denied they'd been hooking up.

âI literally donât even know Odell Beckham. I donât,â Azalea told TMZ at the time.

âHe was at my friendâs party and we took a picture with a bunch of people and thatâs it. I donât know him. Iâve not even had a conversation with him.â

Shortly thereafter, however, Iggy admitted that she and Beckham were more than friends, but insisted they had ""a long way to goâ to become a couple.

Now, they're finally dating openly, but reps for Azalea are still lying about the relationship for some reason:

âItâs new, very fresh,â one insider tells Us.

Apparently, we're all supposed to ignore the fact that Iggy and Odell have clearly been dating for like six months.

We can actually see why Iggy would want to keep her love life out of the headlines.

Her last relationship imploded in spectacular fashion when LA Laker Nick Young was caught cheating on Iggy after his teammate uploaded a candid video of Young confessing to infidelity.

Shortly thereafter, Iggy learned that Young, whom she was engaged to at the time, had gotten another woman pregnant.

An experience like that would make anyone want to keep their next relationship on the DL for as long as possible.

For his part, Odell was previously dating model Polyxeni Ferfeli.

Everyone has a type, and apparently, Odell's is super into chicks with ridiculous names.

We wonder is Polyxeni is also a horrendous rapper ...

2630,"Sour Note! Zayn Forced Into Disastrous Duet With Taylor

RadarOnline.com has learned Zayn Malik and Taylor Swiftâs Fifty Shades Darker duet only came about after he was forced to collaborate with the superstar.

The former One Direction singerÂ recorded the track âI Donât Want To Live Foreverâ for the filmâs soundtrack, but a source noted Swift wasnât a part of his original plan.

âZayn loved the song and wanted it for himself; he was desperate to record it as a solo track and thought it would be a real career boost,â the source explained.

âIt has all of the high notes he can reach and was perfect, but movie bosses said it had to be a collaboration and wanted him to work with Taylor.â

According to the source, 24-year-old Malik relented because Swift, 27, is one of the biggest pop star on the planet â and she happens to be best friends with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid.

Still, âIt was a surprise to everyone,â said the source, noting that âitâs not as if theyâre really great friends and they didnât even appear in scenes together for the video.â

Unfortunately, Malikâs decision may come back to haunt him.

âThe song was a hit with movie fans, but it wasnât massively well received by Taylor or Zaynâs hard-core fan base,â the source told Radar.

The situation isnât the only setback Malikâs weathered recently. He was recently told he couldnât perform on Saturday Night Live with Jimmy Fallon, who chose Harry Styles over him.

âHis team tried to get him on SNL to perform his latest track but they told him no,â the source told Radar.

âThey often have to have two songs, and Harry agreed to do âSign of the Timesâ and âEver Since New Yorkâ. It was disappointing for Zayn, but he just had to move past it.â

UPDATE:Â As new reports continue to surface regardingÂ Rob Kardashian's relationship withÂ MehganÂ James, both took to social mediaÂ to weigh in on the matter.

""Wait reading online about some chick I'm dating Megan something. Not true never even met her or heard of her before,"" he tweetedÂ Thursday.

James retweeted his messageÂ and also wrote on Instagram Friday, ""Before any of you start defaming my character .. I'm CLEARLY not dating rob , nor have I ever confirmed that I was . You all just so happen to believe everything you read. I posted one pair of Arthur George socks 2/3 weeks ago & now all of a sudden I'm a home wrecker, a fraud , a hoe... etc.""

""I'm just 'Megan something.' that most of you 'never heard of,'"" she added. ""I don't have that type of power. I was just as confused as anyone else and was told not to even entertain it.""

As reports swirl around a possible romance between the E! reality star andÂ Mehgan James, E! News can confirm the pair are in fact an item and started dating three months ago. As for what makes their relationship work, an insider tells E! News it's the encouragement Rob feels from theÂ Bad Girls ClubÂ star that's really moved the blossoming flingÂ in a positive direction.

""Mehgan supports Rob and all of his endeavors,Â and just wants to help him,"" the source shares. ""They are very much best friends. She just wants to be there for him.""

And while we've yet to see the celeb couple step out hand-in-hand, James has taken to social media to support her boyfriend's Arthur George sock line. ""MY best friend knows I love socks & The Kardashians. So she got me a 2 in one,"" she wrote on Instagram last month.

The death of Owen Wilsonâs beloved dad has friends fearing the tortured actor might spiral back into a pit of depression!

âOwen is devastated over his dadâs death,â confided a source. âHe meant the world to him!â

Legendary TV producer Robert Wilson â father to actors Owen, Luke and Andrew â died at 75 on May 5 after a years-long struggle with Alzheimerâs disease.

âFor me and my brothers, there just wasnât a bigger influence on us,â said the Zoolander star, 48. âI really believe that his spirit gets carried on through me.â

As RadarOnline.com reported, Wilson was rushed to the hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. in August 2007, after swallowing a fistful of prescription pills and cutting his wrists in a suicide bid.

Pals revealed the actor had been devastated over a string of failed romances, including a bitter breakup with actress Kate Hudson.

By early 2008, Owen was boozing again, and friends feared it could trigger another suicide attempt.

Now the loss of his father has sparked new fears for the Wedding Crashers comedian.

Sources close to the actor tell us that he didnât want to split with his wife of eight years.

According to pals, their marriage broke down over the course of about a year, in spite of trying couplesâ therapy.

The long slide coincided with the recording of Fergieâs first solo album in 11 years, âDouble Dutchess.â

â[Fergie] was very focused on her album and being a rock star again, and Josh felt like she was going back to her âold ways,â â weâre told.

2503,"Miley Cyrus 'In Tears,' May Quit 'The Voice' Amid Epic War With Adam Levine And Blake Shelton?

The Voice TV singing competition show is fond of using fighting metaphors, from battle rounds to knock-outs. But this season, there's speculation that there are just as many battles being fought when the cameras are turned off as when viewers are watching. Is new coach Miley Cyrus secretly involved in a war with seasoned coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton?

Billboard pointed out that when it comes to the impressions of Miley and the other new coach, Alicia Keys, they're hitting the high notes of a position that can challenge even the most accomplished singer.

Coaches are tasked with taking on aspiring crooners, guiding them through the competition and providing them with tips on everything from stage presence to blending with the band. Even though Blake and Adam are experienced at banter, Cyrus and Keys immediately showed they were up to the challenge of teasing the guys while luring the best contestants onto their teams.

But what viewers can't see is the drama unfolding among Shelton, Levine, and Miley, according to OK. The battle has become so intense that Cyrus was hurt to the point of tears, and now she's doing her best to stay on the show and avoid quitting.

Team Miley seems to be rocking it when it comes to attracting the best wanna-be singers on the show, but sources cited by OK revealed that the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer is struggling because of the incessant feuding. However, even though she's battling both Blake and Adam, she is trying to stay strong, added one of the insiders.

Cyrus has ""been in tears"" during the filming of the singing competition TV show, with her tears caused by Adam ""constantly"" picking on her, revealed the source. Levine allegedly didn't stop with annoying Miley himself. Instead, he also persuaded his buddy Blake to ""gang up"" on the younger singer, added the insider.

Moreover, the feud reportedly has been gradually building to a crescendo, with Cyrus and Adam ""at each others' throats"" since the first day of filming, according to the source.

""[Levine] wants nothing to do with [Miley],"" summed up the insider.

Even though Adam has recruited Blake to help him annoy Cyrus, the source shared that it's Levine who is focused on feuding.

As for just how bad it's gotten, Cyrus has threatened that she will quit The Voice as a result of the environment becoming ""so bad,"" added the insider.

Alicia Keys is noticeably absent from the feud allegations, and Miley recently commented on reports that she and Alicia had teamed up so that for the first time, two female coaches could challenge Blake and Adam.

Dishing with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Miley clarified that she had not chosen to unite with Alicia in order to have a ""boys against girls"" competition on The Voice. Instead, she has been siding with Keys because being sandwiched between Adam and Blake was infuriating, reported 98.7 Radio.

Despite reports claiming that Levine is bickering with Cyrus, she told Jimmy that in reality, it's Adam and Shelton who are arguing constantly.

""It never stops,"" she revealed about the bickering between Blake and Adam. ""Even when the cameras are off, that is real.""

Cyrus admitted that when she viewed the show, she assumed that the playful banter was just done for the cameras. But rather than end when filming stops, Levine and Shelton keep right on bickering.

""I always thought it was like a little thing they do on camera, no, it's all day,"" she summed up.

Her vanity comes before our vets! In a slap in the face to Americaâs courageous wounded warriors, First Lady MICHELLE OBAMA used Walter Reed Army Medical Center as her own personal outpatient plastic surgery clinic, The National ENQUIRER has learned.

âItâs appalling!â fumed Jill Farrell of Judicial Watch. âWith taxpayers picking up the tab for her ski trips to Aspen and beach outings to Hawaii, we might as well pay for her abs and butt, too!â

Michelle was whisked to the hospital with âthe utmost secrecyâ in the summer of 2011, a source told The ENQUIRER.

âSecret Service agents were stationed both inside and outside the operating room. Michelle had fat sucked from her abdomen, hips and butt.â

While such procedures can take up to two hours, âshe was done in 45 minutes to an hour.â

Whatâs more, the source added, âWhen elective surgery is done, even if itâs cosmetic, the surgeonâs fee is waived. If Michelle paid anything, it would have been just for the anesthesiologist.

âBecause Michelle is First Lady though, I wouldnât be surprised if the government picked up the total tab, meaning taxpayers forked over their hard-earned dollars to satisfy her vanity!â

The ENQUIRER has also learned Michelle, 51, has likely had more than just liposuction at such military facilities.

We asked a panel of top plastic surgeons to analyze before-and-after photos of the First Lady, and each agreed the mother of two has undergone a so-called âliquid faceliftâ with Botox and filler injections, plus a nose job!

âA little Botox helps to smooth out those forehead lines earned during the last campaign,â theorized Dr. Lyle Back. âI can [also] see the rhinoplasty work she had done is very obvious. It is superb, sophisticated work, though.â

Dr. Otto Placik said Michelle now has fewer crowâs feet, indicating sheâs had âdefinite Botox,â as well as a Hollywood-ready smile.

He added: âHer lips are fuller, indicating fillers into both upper and lower lips. Besides that, her marionette lines [running down from the corners of her mouth] are almost completely gone.â

Respected plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Dayan added: âShe has a decrease in the height of her smile, which can happen when a lot of filler is placed in the cheeks and smile lines.â

The expertsâ conclusions further incensed Jill, who charged: âMichelle Obama is taking up needed space while veterans are awaiting care and suffering. Itâs a crying shame!â

2648,"Taylor Swift Spending Millions of Dollars on New Boyfriend, Joe Alwyn: False News or True? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Pop superstar Taylor Swift is buying new boyfriend Joe Alwyn by squandering millions of dollars on her lover according to some reports. Taylor has always been the bigger money earner in all of her relationships. Even though past boyfriends such as Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Tom Hiddleston, and Calvin Harris were millionaires, their bank accounts still paled in comparison to Taylorâs whopping $300 million estimated net worth.

But, Taylor Swift is now dating relatively unknown actor, Joe Alwyn, who has yet to see big-screen success, and fans are wondering if itâs true or false news that she is spending millions of dollars supporting the relationship. His first film, âBilly Lynnâs Long Halftime Walkâ garnered him good reviews from critics, but not much of a paycheck. In fact, Joe has admitted to still living at home with his parents in London.

Taylor Swift met Joe Alwyn last fall through mutual friends and decided to move to London in order to be closer to the struggling actor. She rented a beautiful home in North London close to where Joeâs parents lived. Home rentals in London are some of the most expensive in the world, with some claiming a London rental can cost twice as much as renting elsewhere, but Taylor thought Joe was worth it and signed a six month lease so the two could be together.

Now comes word that she is yet again willing to drop a ton of cash for the actor. Taylor is reportedly shopping for a home for the two of them to share in Londonâs affluent Chelsea neighborhood. Money is no object and she is willing to pay millions to live in the wealthy neighborhood which other famous Brits, including Pippa Middleton call home.

Although she and Joe will be spending the majority of their time at her house in Los Angeles so he can work on future film roles, Joe is very close to his parents and wants a home close to them so he can visit often and Taylor is willing to make that happen.

Itâs not only real-estate that the Grammy winner is willing to spend money on when it comes to her new love. Taylor and Joe have been traveling using her private jets , and just this weekend, the two were seen boarding her private plane in London. The pair first flew to LA to let Joe get settled in Taylorâs home and then the couple headed to Nashville so her new beau could meet her parents.

While itâs true that Taylor Swift apparently doesnât mind spending millions of dollars on Joe Alwyn, some of the singerâs own fans are starting to feel embarrassed that the pop star is the one footing all the bills and are wondering if a relationship will work out between the two in the long run. Others are just are hoping that with this move to Los Angeles, other movie offers will come in and his career will finally start to take off.

If there were concerns about no one wanting to dance with Ryan Lochte because of fan backlash, we can't imagine how hard it would be for Donald to find a willing partner. The Republican nominee comes up with a new hateful message each week getting Democrats angrier and angrier at him. However, on Aug. 24 he seemed to be softening his immigration stance on Hannity, so maybe he would do this to become more likable? We'll just have to see when the full cast list comes out!

2632,"Tyra Banks Sued for Causing 'Emotional Distress' During âAmericaâs Got Talentâ Taping

*A contestant on âAmericaâs Got Talentâ saysÂ her performance at a recent taping was roastedÂ so viciously byÂ new host Tyra BanksÂ that it has caused emotional distress to her young daughter, who was watching from the wings.

The woman, identified in the filing as Jane Doe, filed a lawsuit against Banks on Tuesday in L.A. Superior Court accusing the former modelÂ of battery and assault, and seekingÂ damages for infliction of emotional distress, reports Variety.

Jane Doe says she and her husband were performing an ode to theirÂ daughter, identified as Mary, duringÂ a taping on March 19. Once they finished, the woman says that she and her husband were âhumiliatedâ by the judges and the audience, who criticized the song.

According to the suit, Banks added to the humiliation by making fun of the song in front of Mary. Jane Doe alleges that Banks pulled her daughterâs hair back, physically manipulated her, and insinuated that the girl was accidentally conceived.

Afterward, âMary was traumatized and became deeply depressed,â the suit states. âMary would become extremely nervous and anxious whenever, among other triggering events, she hears any mentions of [the] song and [the] song itself, whenever she ruminates about the events during or related to the performance, and whenever she thinks about the prospective televised airing or use online of Jane Doe and her husband, their performance, as well as the airing and use online of any footages of Mary.â

Reality show contestants typically sign waivers acknowledging that they may be subjected to ridicule and humiliation. However, the suit alleges that Marathon Productions got Mary to sign a contract without her parentsâ knowledge or consent, according to Variety.

After the contestant complained, the company communicated that it would not feature Mary in the broadcast. However, the couple asked that the entire performance not be aired. That request was refused.

2423,"'Jealous' Kim Tries To Steal Beyonce's Baby Spotlight

While the Bey Hive was buzzing yesterday about Beyonce's shocking baby news, RadarOnline.com has learned that Kim Kardashian was busy with her own plan to steal back the spotlight!

""Kim was shocked at the Beyonce news and she was totally checking it out and seeing how many people like the post,"" an insider told Radar. ""Then when her friend Chrissy Teigen started Tweeting that she was best friends with Beyonce, she was actually hurt and worried.""

As Radar has reported, there is a longstanding rivalry between Queen Bey and Kardashian, 36, and according to an insider, Kardashian is not letting it go anytime soon!

""That's why she started Tweeting,"" the source told Radar. ""She thinks she's a bigger star than Beyonce. She is the biggest star in the world."" And it was time to remind her fans.

The first attempt came right after Beyonce announced the news. Kardashian took to her Twitter to share with her fans that she had finally updated her app, Kim Kardashian Hollywood!

""Had to change up my look in #KimKardashianGame! Have you guys seen the latest update? @KKHOfficial,"" Kardashian wrote on Twitter.

Seeing that had not done anything to put a dent in Beyonce's big news, the KUWTK wife of Yeezy rapper, Kanye West, tried yet again â by announcing that she and pal, Chrissy Tiegen, were starting their own book club.

""So guys..... @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club!,"" Kardashian posted. Sadly, no massive celebrations erupted like she was hoping.

But that's not all! Earlier in the day, Kardashian misled fans to believe that she and West, 39, were ALSO expecting another child together. When a fan asked it it were true, however, Kardashian quickly shot it down.

""While everyone was tweeting and sending congratulations to Beyonce and Jay Z, Kim and Kanye did not say one word about it on their social media,"" the source told Radar.

""The fact that Beyonce is going to have more kids than Kim once her twins are born absolutely drives Kim nuts!""

""Kim was totally trying to steal Beyonce's baby thunder yesterday.""

As Radar reported, Kardashian and West â like Beyonce and Jay Z â hit several rough patches in their superstar union this year, leading many to believe that the two were headed for a messy divorce.

But it seems that one sure-fire way to get over a slump is by getting another baby bump!

""Kim is going to try harder than ever right now to get pregnant because she is constantly searching for a way to one up Beyonce,"" the insider claimed. ""She seems so jealous that Beyonce is more famous than she is. It doesn't seem like Kim will ever, be okay with that.""

Do you think that Kim Kardashian should get pregnant so that she can have as many children as Beyonce has? Tell us your thoughts below.

2558,"Expectant Kylie Jenner Is An âEmotional Wreckâ While In Hiding, Source Reveals â âShe Feels So Alone!â

Whatâs even worse is that her only real help, matriarch Kris Jenner doesnât really have the time to deal with her youngest daughterâs drama. According to new reports, the stress of having to keep her pregnancy under wraps has been taking a toll on 20-year-old Kylie Jenner.

âHonestly, Kylie is just an emotional wreck right now. She doesnât know what to do or who to trust, and sheâs just so vulnerable right now,â one source close to the Kardashians revealed.

The young makeup mogulâs life inexperience in the face of such a huge change may be to blame for her meltdown.

The insider assured us that Kylie, who is expecting her first baby with boyfriend Travis Scott, is much more scared than what she lets the fans see.

âShe doesnât know how to be an adult, let alone a mother. She is feeling so alone!â the source added.

And while Kylie has been craving her momâs care and help through this confusing change, Kris is reportedly way too busy to give Kylie the attention she needs.

In addition, Kris was planning to offer her youngest daughter a big spin-off show about her life as a young mother as well as an awesome pregnancy reveal but Kylie is getting way too impatient of staying hidden after so many years of enjoying the spotlight.

âKylieâs just tired of being in hiding. She hates that she has to keep it a big secret for Kris. It has created a lot of tension between the two of them and there was already a lot of tension, to begin with,â the spy dished.

2575,"Kevin Hart Begs Wife Eniko Parrish For Forgiveness With $250000 Push Gift

Kevin Hart is telling himself â nothing says âI am sorry for cheating and humiliating youâ like a $250,000 gift.

If the latest rumors are accurate, Hart feels bad for his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, after getting caught in a sex scandal with stripper and singer Montia Sabbag and is, therefore, willing to spend a small fortune on a lavish baby shower and a push present.

A friend of the comedian told a popular publication that he is going to shower the woman carrying his baby with diamonds to show how committed he is to their marriage.

The person told the media outlet: âKevin [Hart] is planning the ultimate push present to give to his wife, Eniko [Parrish]. He has not picked it out yet, but he has decided that it is going to be very expensive and have lots of diamonds. He wants this present to be a symbol of his love and commitment to Eniko and their new baby. Kevin asked his assistant to help pick out a super bling ring, necklace, or something classy out for Eniko in the $250k price range. Kevin is determined to prove to Eniko that he loves her and wants their relationship to last.â

Another insider claimed that Hart has nothing to worry about because while his wife is hurt, she is deep in the third trimester, and has no plans to raise a baby alone.

The source explained: âEniko is hurt and angry, but she is nowhere near ready to walk away. She simply canât imagine her life without Kevin. He is her world, and it has been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.â

The pal shared that Parrish is focused living a stress-free life and having a healthy baby.

The friend revealed: âLeaving him is not even a question, she is in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her childâs needs come first. And right now Eniko knows she needs to stay as calm and centered as possible. Breaking up with Kevin right now is only going to put more stress on her.â

Some commenters say that Hart should be honest with himself and start an open marriage if that is not already the case.

2545,"Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' Expires

Now hereâs something to really jump up and down on the couch for.

Hollywoodâs worst-kept romantic secretâthe relationship between Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmesâis finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in Malibu on Labor Day, wearing matching fedoras no less.

They have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together.

Indeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction.

The absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site RadarOnline.

In September last year,Â RadarÂ claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from Top Gun star Cruise, Holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage.

âKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man forÂ five years after the divorce,â the source claimed.

âSheâs allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and sheâs not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,â the insider told Radar. âKatie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the termsâand got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.â

Cruise and Holmes agreed to a divorce settlement in just 10 days, with the pact reportedly stipulating Suri would not have any contact with Cruiseâs religion, Scientology.

However, had Holmes broken the rules about âembarrassingâ Cruise, she could have lost the money, the source alleged.

If true, that five-year period would have ended in Juneâwhich may explain why the couple has now come out.

Remarkably, most observers believe Foxx and Holmes have been together since 2013âabout a year after her split fromÂ Tom Cruiseâwhen they were photographed dancing together at a charity bash in The Hamptons.

But they have largely avoided being photographed together and consistently denied they are a couple since then.

There have been a few slips; for example, Katie was seen with aÂ ring on her fingerÂ in March 2016, but Foxxâs rep said it wasnât from him.

It was claimed the two met at each otherâs homes and that Katie sometimes disguised herself with wigs and hats to meet up with Foxx without being noticed.

In March 2015, a photo surfaced showing the two stars sitting in a recording studio holding hands.

Jamie is seen reclining in his chair, holding Katieâs hand and gazing at her, with his legs subtly intertwining hers. The actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of Jamieâs, while his other foot sneaks around her calf.

Foxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were âjust friends.â

In December 2015, Holmes was a guest at Jamieâs surprise birthday party in New York at La Bilboquet restaurant.

And soon after, she was spotted at The Honor Bar in Beverly Hills with the actorâs youngest daughter, Annalise.

In June 2016, there seemed to be the first public confirmation that Foxx and Holmes were, indeed, in a relationship whenÂ former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan, a friend, said they were dating.

âHe is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy,â Claudia said during an interview for the Allegedly podcast.

However, Jordan quickly retracted, telling Entertainment Tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had âno knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.â

âIâve never seen them together. Heâs never told me heâs dating her,â she said.

In April this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in New York, and in May they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. They were photographed leaving the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel separately.

To make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled âin cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,â Us WeeklyÂ reported in April.

The couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of Tom Cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives.

Behind the scenes, the two divas are feuding! While the finalists of The Voice are getting ready to compete for the grand prize, sources on the set revealed that the real completion is in fact between superstar singers Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson!

As fans of The Voice probably already know, last week, the network announced that Hudson and Clarkson, both 35 years old, have signed contracts to join the vocal competition.

However, the two divas quickly clarified that they would not appear on the same season of the hit show!

Reportedly, we will see Hudson on it sooner, as she is set to coach during season 13, while Clarkson will have to wait until season 14 to show herself.

With that being said, one question, in particular, comes to mind â why canât they appear on The Voice at the same time?

The answer comes from an on-set source who told us that âKelly and Jennifer really cannot stand each other!â

âKelly was completely blindsided when she saw that Jennifer was cast because no one had told her about it,â the insider added.

But even though Hudson and Clarkson are not going to meet on the show, after all, that doesnât mean the set is safe from the drama.

Considering that Miley Cyrus is set to return for Season 13, the insider revealed that pretty much everyone hopes for some âcattinessâ between her and Jennifer Hudson.

âIt would be so great!â

What do you think of Jennifer Hudson being added as a vocal coach for season 13? Was she the right choice?

There have been numerous reports of Justin Bieber spending time in church in the past few months, but what we didn't realize was it wasn't any old church he was visiting â it was the church of past relationships.

Bieber's fans are currently convinced the 23-year-old pop-star has been abiding by a ""Love Bible"" he wrote while rekindling his romance with ex, Selena Gomez, and reports even claim the ""Sorry"" singer has â10 Commandmentsâ for their ârevived relationship.â

The relationship âjust might lastâ this time around because he âmade himself a list of 10 commandments"" for wooing his on-and-off girlfriend, an âinsiderâ is quoted as saying, adding that Bieber has been following the commandments âreligiously.""

He's also reportedly sworn off partying and is meditating daily to stay focused.

âSome of the commandments are all about romance,"" the insider says, explaining that others are just about being ""open and trustworthy"" and a few are about being more present for Gomez.

While no full list has been revealed, the source claimed ""Thou shalt cook food for your girlfriendâ is one of them, which anyone can get on board with.

Besides, Bieber was spotted giving his Pastor an 18 second hug last week, and that's all the evidence I need to know he's changing his ways and is ready to accept Christ back into his life.

This boy has always loved a good bible.

For now the rest of us will just have to stick to the 10 commandments of being a Belieber, because thou shalt NEVER say NEVER.

Pitt mingled with former wife Jennifer Aniston's fellow cast Courteney Cox in the famous TV show Friends who also made the scene. In his black dress and same old hair style Pitt looks returning to his shape again.

It can be recalled that Pitt 53, and former wife Jolie 41 filed a divorce in September, then on December Pitt claimed Jolie was publicizing the custody case to manipulate the situation now they came to an agreement of handling children's custody more privately. Â In aÂ joint statement released on Tuesday, they vowed to keep court documents private, and a united front was affirmed while custody battle over their six children is still ongoing - Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.

Ellen DeGeneres stepped out with a mystery brunette recently amid rumors of her impending divorce with wife Portia de Rossi. Photos of the TV host all smiles with the unknown woman only fuelled speculations of their separation.

According to reports, DeGeneres stepped out with the mystery brunette on June 1. She enjoyed a vegan meal with the mystery woman at Crossroads in West Hollywood. The host seemed to be in a jolly mood as she and her date left the restaurant.

Photos emerged of the pair leaving the restaurant and walking the street. DeGeneres did not seem perturbed by the attention and at one point even waved at the camera. She also continued to smile for the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the mystery brunette appeared bothered by all the attention and continued to keep her head down. DeGeneres' wife de Rossi was nowhere to be found.

DeGeneres' date supposedly came after she and de Rossi were spotted bickering at each other at a restaurant. The host's cheerful demeanor with her mystery date supposedly also differs from the previous weeks, when she appeared tense with de Rossi.

Photos of DeGeneres with the mystery brunette only seem to fuel rumors about her divorce with de Rossi. However, the host has since denied these claims. She told PeopleÂ in a previous interview that her marriage with de Rossi remains intact. ""I can't imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world,"" DeGeneres said.

Likewise, she shut down rumors about her divorce with de Rossi in an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM. ""We really don't almost break up, we don't fight, we're madly in love, and I guess it's boring,"" DeGeneres said as quoted by Entertainment Tonight.

DeGeneres also admitted that she does not read the tabloid. She does not pay attention to the divorce rumors surrounding her marriage to de Rossi. This probably explains why she appears cheerful and at ease during her date with the mystery brunette.

""The house had been remodeled, so Ellen thought it would have no trace of the former owner,"" said a pal. ""But she was wrong. Within a few nights of moving in, Ellen started hearing random noises, including footÂ­steps and doors opening and closing.

""Then, in the middle of the night, she heard a woman's faint cry.

She hasn't had a solid night's sleep since she moved in.""

She said she's never been a believer in ghosts or spirits, the source continued, ""but she doesn't have any other explanation for the mysterious sounds and voices.""

The boo-tiful mansion, a 13,000-square-foot architectural masterpiece, was built for real esÂ­tate developer Sidney Brody and his wife Frances in 1951. Known as the Brody House, it's located in the exclusive Holmby Hills neighborhood next door to the famed Playboy Mansion. Brody died in 1983. His wife, a renowned art collector and philanthropist, passed away in the house at age 93 after a long illness.

After her death, an invesÂ­tor purchased the home and completely remodeled it. Real estate maven Ellen then bought the nine-bedroom, eight-bathroom spread in early January.

""It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Ellen couldn't pass up,"" said the source.

According to the source, Ellen said she's convinced the noises and voices she hears are Frances Brody's, and Ellen thinks Mrs. Brody's spirit can't bear to part with the house, even in the afterlife.

""Friends have convinced Ellen to conduct a spiritual cleansing ceremony in the house,"" the source said. ""She doesn't want her new home to have any bad energy, and she's not going to share it with Frances Brody.""
